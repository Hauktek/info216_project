    schema:articleBody """As I swipe through my news feed and stories, I find it tiring to keep consuming content.
So, I decided to write me a post to jot down the random thoughts that came into my mind during this pandemic. It is, after all, during times of crisis that reflective thinking is important, that we can deeply inspect and learn more about our tendencies and life values or philosophies.
This will be a free writing, stream-of-consciousness style of writing as I would like my thoughts to be as raw and as unfiltered as possible. Here goes.
As I’m typing, I ought to feel very privilege and blessed to be healthy and (in a way) rich, to be able to afford a laptop and stable network connection, not to mention a room of my own, air-conditioned and well-lit. I have sufficient food to last me for a week during this movement restriction order period. Plus, I still have work to do and I still have my paycheck at the end of the month, to keep me going and sustain my livelihood.
My portfolio is sitting at -30% loss at the moment, but I’m thankful that I still have holding power as I still have my emergency savings to last me through winter, yet I do not know when would winter end. I grieved hard for the hard-earned money and the possible profit I could have make if I were to be smarter and quicker in handling my portfolio. Then again, who would have foresee this coming?
As I’m working from home, I don’t really get to spend much of my cash. The imaginary lifestyle of travelling, shopping, eating out, dressing up is all brought to an abrupt halt. These are luxuries that we want, but not necessarily need. This makes me wonder, if we do need so much money. If it is wise if we trade our time and probably happiness and satisfaction working on a day job we find depressing, for that stash of cash that you might not get to spend anyway.
How much money is enough?
When we talk about money, we’ll inevitably touch the topic of work and having a career or building your career. But have you ever wondered what does your career or work means to you, other than a source of income? Some of us are fixated to rising the career ladder as a means to get a higher pay, which is no doubt true, but at what cost? If money is what we yearn for, there is surely other ways to earn. As we spend almost 8 to 10 hours in our day job, assuming you are an employee, what value are we creating? and are those values aligned with our values?
Assuming if we live till a ripe age of 70 and if you’re in your mid-twenties, there’s at least 4 decades, 40 years for you to work on something. Of course, the thing is we never know what the future hold and we never know when we will go, especially with this pandemic and virus going around. If you do get it, and managed to recover, your lungs may not work as well as before. I certainly wish not to catch the virus, as I’m still looking to run a 100km.
Anyway, this unsettling period is a good time to think about what really matters, and what is the purpose of living, which would vary between each individual. What drives your will to live? Is it ambition? Is it accomplishment? Is it making a mark, leaving a legacy? Is it fear of death? Why do you want to live? Or are you living because, you are? Are you just enduring life? I do sometimes feel like I’m just enduring life and when difficult times come, it feels hard to live on. I am still questioning the reason why I am waking up, going to work, eating, sleeping, bathing, and doing my routines. Maybe, we don’t need to have a reason to live and that is fine as well.
I always told myself, if I had time, I’d definitely learn how to code and learn how to do digital painting and designing, learn Japanese, paint more, understand the stock market and investing, and do a whole bunch of things. During this period, I find myself not doing them, although I had so much time in my hands. I generally want to be a better person by improving myself. What is a better person though?
A guideline that we can take is, as we look towards other, seeing that they are better, in what aspect are they better? We envy or admire what we wish to have or aspire to be. Being aware of whatever pushes our button would give us better control of ourselves and our mind. A very significant trend nowadays are people sharing their career successes, travelling photos, exquisite meals, expensive cars and houses, having a good-looking partner and in a blossoming relationship, and probably a great body, all signifying grandiosity and to a certain extent – excessiveness. Many of us strive towards achieving those things and sustaining it, seemingly – pleasurable things.
What’s next though after attaining those seemingly unreachable things?
I feel like I’m going off tangent. I may not even be alive in the next one year.
We can only hope and do the best we can.

I haven’t written anything for so long that I am feeling rusty, and didn’t really want my return to be a plague diary – but hey ho.
Oxfam is closed, so all those lovely books ( and indeed the not so lovely ones – Jeremy Clarkson included) will be sitting there waiting for new homes for some time to come (perhaps not Jeremy Clarkson…)
Meanwhile, we usually are fans of hunkering down.
And usually that comes with winter and log fires and telly and the dog asleep on some piece of furniture, a stew in the Aga and friends for a long Sunday lunch.
Now it comes with all the above except it is Spring, and we can’t have anyone in the house.
We are the really privileged and I am seriously aware of that – we can afford to be where we are with no financial worries, we have a decent sized garden and are surrounded by fields.
But these are jittery times, strange times, no point of reference times, the calm before the storm times.
The times when you watch what is happening in Italy and marvel at the efforts being made to save lives and at the same time hope you never need to ask that for yourself or people you know.
I’d like to think this was bringing out the best in me but just like my inner cleaner, I am finding it quite hard to locate by better inner self at the moment.
But here are two things that made my day:
My lovely next door neighbour managed by a slip of the cursor to get 4 kilos of carrots in her Ocado order.
In a few weeks time she’d probably be able to sell those on some black market for shares in Zoom, but right now she has given me some.
My BB, never knowingly cooking a thing in his life, and who has a sweet tooth which he has been nurturing for all his years, did not seem to run through the options of soup, purees, carrot curry ( but then who would?) and came up instantly with carrot cake. (Recipes that don’t involve cream cheese all welcome.)
We are also about to spend some happy hours filling envelopes with advice and support stuff from our Parish Council for the locals, and another lovely neighbour offered to help.
Now normally, I would have flapped my hands and asked half the village in to help but had to say that we would manage.
She said, it would all go better with a glass of wine and I said, we should have stocked up with more of the white stuff – ten minutes later, a lovely bottle was delivered to our doorstep.
That will make today fine. Hope yours is too. Share this:"""^^xsd:string ;

    schema:articleBody """In 1933, as Franklin D. Roosevelt took his oath of office as the 32nd President of the United States, his people were hurting. From Texas to Detroit to every state in between, citizens were struggling through a 25% unemployment rate, a series of natural disasters, widespread housing foreclosures and food shortages, a stock market that had tumbled by 90%, and little hope for recovery as the Great Depression took hold. Directed by gifted filmmaker Robert Stone, The Civilian Conservation Corps outlines one of the most daring and consequential of the public programs enacted by Roosevelt during this time, a tenant of the New Deal that continues to resonate in our modern world.
Up until that time, the public did not necessarily look upon the government as an engine for bettering their daily lives. Roosevelt's New Deal restructured the function of the government in an unprecedented manner. As part of this string of new programs, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was designed to reward meaningful work while improving upon the environmental vitality of the nation. Toiling over a period of six months in labor camps across the country, program participants were paid a daily wage to plant trees, repair gullies and embark on other conversation projects. This was many years before environmentalism became one of the country's chief movements.
Roosevelt looked upon the program as a win-win proposition; these efforts would enhance the value of the country's natural resources while keeping its most vulnerable citizens employed. Nevertheless, a vocal opposition did emerge, and blasted the president for ignoring the interests of business, deficit spending and corporate taxes.
The story of the CCC is vividly captured through a wealth of impressive archived materials and a series of new interviews with the men who signed up for the program up until the time of its demise in 1942. The narrative they weave is one of pride, prosperity and patriotism.
The Civilian Conservation Corps is a beautifully assembled and meticulously rendered slice of American history. But it is by no means a dry history lesson; instead, it makes this long-passed era feel personal and inspirational.

Malaysia is well known as a welfare state , so I really conffident and believe government have the ability to give a hand to those who need the government help nor matter it is individual , organisation , or business.
Malaysia government can implement following action to help our beloves Malaysian
1. Provide atleast RM 1200 to all Malaysian who losses their job such as tourist guide , bus driver, shop retailer , hawker ,oil industry and entertainment.
2. Provide low interest loan to all business .
3. Lower the income tax of M40 and B40.
4. Lower the company tax.
5.Give higher special elaun to frontliner RM500 per person because they risk themselves to fight the desease. Some doctor and nurse work 14 hours a day to cope with patient.
6. Provide at least 20 billion economic stimulus plan because our stock market is down drastically and our currency values also down.
7. Allow EPF contributer to take out some of the money to pay their bill.
8. Lower the electricity bill and water bill by atleast 20 percent. (international fuel prices decrease drastically since last year)
9.Provide free consultant to all workers and business that face difficulty.
10. If really cannot provide free tertiary education for our sons, government should atleast reduce the tuition fee for all Malaysian in IPTA and IPTS.
Government should reduce our burden not to increase it. I know Malaysian will have a hard time to go through because Brent crude oil is now under 30 dollar a tong government revenue will reduce atleast 20 billions Ringgit Malaysia if I am not mistaken. Tourism industry also damage by COVID-19 . Ringgit Malaysia plunged to its lowest level since 2017 as US Dollar indicator rise to its highest level level since 2008 financial crisis. Next financial crisis will come soon , Malaysia government please be prepared to protect Malaysian from the chaos. Thanks."""^^xsd:string ;

    schema:articleBody """California is experiencing the single longest economic growth period in its history. The housing values in Fallbrook have been steadily climbing since the first quarter of 2009.
The last few years have seen 2% increments, but values have continued to rise. As a seller, the current value of your home has met or exceeded where it was in 2005-2006. Homes priced above $750,000 experienced the largest sales increase ever reported.
Most sellers who contact the office are moving out of California. They are looking for a place with lower taxes, so their retirement nest egg will last longer. They are prepared to forgo the great weather in Fallbrook for a less expensive and more comfortable lifestyle.
Prices in these new locations are noticeably lower than in California, which is why people are considering Idaho, Texas, Tennessee, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, North and South Carolina, Florida and Georgia.
Owning real estate provides a clear safe harbor for gaining wealth. The stock market is showing its vulnerability, with both the steepest loss since October 1987’s “Black Monday,” falling 27.6% and the biggest gain since October 1987, climbing over 9%, all in the same week. All that said, real estate value continues to remain stable in Fallbrook.
Interest rates have also shown volatility this past week. Reaching a low of 3%, leading to enormous volumes of refinance business, which prompted the banks to artificially raise rates due to their lack of liquidity. The most recent 100-point drop-in interest rates by Federal Reserve, should eventually move the mortgage rates back closer to 3%, but how soon is unclear.
Despite the volatility, current interest rates remain near 4% which is historically low. These low interest rates do not just benefit buyers. When interest rates drop, it expands the pool of buyers who can afford your home. There currently is over a 2-point spread between the 10-year Treasury bond and the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, which would predict that there might be additional reductions in mortgage interest rates.
In January, the Federal Housing Administration loan limit increased to $701,500 and Veterans Affairs loans have no limit. Inventory levels are less than 50% of normal and the current month’s supply of detached homes is a scant 2.5 months, which benefits sellers.
A balanced market has a six-month supply. Buyers are braving this challenging market in large numbers, so why are sellers waiting on the sidelines?
Put all of this together, in the hands of a professional Realtor with strong negotiating skills and you have the making of a very successful sale. So, why wait?
Many sellers we meet with are considering selling but believe that they can wait awhile. Waiting is always an option, but given the current market activity, with no guarantee on the future, I would recommend getting off the fence and jump in.
There may be some who are reading this, thinking that if it is so good and with consumer confidence being so high, why not wait awhile? The thing about hoping to find the “top” of a market is you never know it is the top until it drops, and it is rolling down and you can never recapture the top.
For many of the reasons mentioned above, it is also a great time to buy! Based on the numbers of buyers looking at our listings, this is not a secret. Home prices are gently rising, gone are the days of huge jumps from month to month.
Even though inventory is low, there are motivated sellers who have made the decision to move to their next location, and they are marketing their home at a fair price.
Interest rates are low, and even though they might go lower, it’s just like the seller who looks to sell only at the peak, if a buyer is waiting to buy only when interest rates are at the bottom, we won’t know the bottom is here, until rates start to go back up, and you can never recapture that previously lower rate.
Many lenders will lock a buyer into a rate and, if the rate drops, adjust the loan to the lower interest rate, so the risk is minimized.
With rates this low, it is a good time to consider purchasing an investment property or second home. Even if housing, like the stock market, has an adjustment, rents have consistently risen over the past decade.
As the shortage of housing in all price-points, especially workforce housing and first-time homebuyers housing, continues, the demand for rentals and therefore the price to rent will remain stable and possibly climb. What better way to protect your future, then through passive income received from a rental property?
Despite the current world news, real estate remains a solid investment, and there appears to be no better time to sell or buy. We’d love to talk to you about what that looks like for you.

    schema:articleBody """Since February 19, stock markets have been falling, with the series of roller coaster sessions leaving investors reeling. In the last two weeks, markets fell in six out of ten trading sessions, and the drops were larger than the gains. The S&P 500 finished Friday’s trading session down by 4.4%, and hit a three-year low.
Falling markets, however difficult they may be for traders’ portfolio values and companies’ market caps, can be accommodated. Investors can get used to lower stock prices, or can switch to bearish strategies to cope. The bigger question now is, will the economy as a whole get pushed into a recession, and if so, how long will it last?
These questions are urgent. Goldman Sachs is sounding a red alert, warning of a possible 24% contraction in the US economy for Q2 2020. Not every business sector lends itself to remote work, and those workers don’t have the opportunity now to go out and spend – while the services supported and provided by ‘nonessential workers’ are shutting down. Coronavirus may not be a particularly dangerous disease for everyone, but it’s clearly having an enormous impact.
Impact, however, does not have to mean irreparable damage. You can rescue your portfolio, with some judicious stock choices. We’ve used the TipRanks Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool to find out which stocks the market’s insiders are snapping up, with a view to the long-term and the post-coronavirus recovery. Here are three of their favorite choices.
Fed E x Corporation ( FDX )
Government-ordered shutdowns and quarantines are hurting FedEx for the obvious reasons. The shipping company is seeing less business – stores are ordering less stock, people facing layoffs are placing fewer online orders. As manufacturing begins to return in Asia, conditions are worsening in Europe. Uncertainty is the word of the day for FedEx.
The company’s fiscal Q3 report, covering the period ending February 29, showed a miss on earnings. The $1.41 reported was 5.4% below the $1.49 expected, and less than half the $3.03 shown in the year-ago quarter. Revenues did better, as the $17.5 billion reported was up 2.8% from the year before. The strong revenues reassured investors, and the stock gained after the report; nevertheless, FDX shares are down 27% so far this year.
On a positive note, FDX has kept its 18-year record of reliable dividend payments. The company maintained its 65-cent quarterly payment, announced on March 6 and due out on April 1. The annualized payment of $2.60 gives a yield of 2.34%, higher than the ~2% average among S&P listed peer companies – and far higher than bond yields.
Additionally, at least one insider is bullish on FDX. Board of Directors member John Edwardson has been snapping up shares for the last six months – and his most recent purchase, just last week, was significant to say the least– he shelled out $560,200 for 5,000 shares. This brings his total holding in FedEx to more than 82,000 shares, worth over $9 million. Clearly, Edwardson sees the advantages outweighing the negatives here.
Some of Wall Street’s top analysts would agree. Writing for Cowen, 5-star analyst Helane Becker sees long-term benefits for FedEx: “Social distancing is accelerating the growth of ecommerce, a trend FedEx is well positioned to benefit from. The continued restriction of passenger air travel to certain regions has resulted in reduced belly capacity, leaving an opening for shippers like FedEx to grab share… the company notes Asia manufacturing has started to come back, which should drive increased demand for FedEx's international export service…”
Becker shows some caution by reducing her price target to $156, but still sees an impressive 40% upside potential for the coming year, and maintains her Buy rating on the stock. (To watch Becker’s track record, click here )
Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry , also rated 5-stars by TipRanks, is more bullish, backing her Buy rating with a price target of $159 – suggesting an upside of 43%. (To watch Landry’s track record, click here )"""^^xsd:string ;

The clarifications came amid market talk that the regulator was looking at shorter working hours amid rising coronavirus cases in financial capital Mumbai, which is in a lockdown until at least March 31.
Earlier in the day, one business TV channel reported Sebi and the Finance Ministry were discussing cutting down market hours during lockdown, and were evaluating the final option of keeping stock markets shut.
The report said that if the stock markets are to be shut down temporarily, the expiry date of futures and options contracts could be preponed.
The Maharashtra government on Sunday said Section 144 of CrPC, which prohibits gathering of over five persons at public places, is being imposed in the state to contain the spread of coronavirus.
Making the announcement, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the measure was being taken in urban areas across the state from Monday to ensure social distancing.
The total number coronavirus cases in India surged to 341 at the time of writing of this report. Five of the ten people, who tested positive for the coronavirus in Maharashtra on Sunday, got the infection through local transmission, state Health Minister Rajesh Tope said.
The Centre and state governments decided to completely lock down 75 districts across the country where coronavirus cases have been reported, officials said on Sunday.
The districts where lockdown was announced are from states that include Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It has also been decided that all trains will be stopped till March 31, and no Metro rail and inter-state buses will operate till month end"""^^xsd:string ;

Hope Marlene Custer
A deadly virus, plummeting stock market, isolation—current news is certainly a reason for despair.
If you are feeling that your future is looking bleak, let me offer you some hope!
Having hope means you expect something good even though it seems impossible.
With the world in ‘meltdown mode,’ it is essential to turn to Scripture.
A good example for us to look at is Jeremiah, the prophet during the last days before Judah went into exile.
It was not a popular thing to do to proclaim judgment and the imminent fall of a kingdom.
As dismal as circumstances were at this time, he still proclaimed that because he was confident in God’s love, he had hope. (Lamentations 3:21, 22 NIV)
As predicted by Jeremiah, Israel was taken into exile, but in God’s timing, the nation was restored.
Eventually, Israel’s greatest hope was realized in the coming of Jesus.
And it is Jesus that we must turn to today.
We must repent and call upon Him to renew our hope.
God’s word reminds us, “Do not be anxious about anything, but ... present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:6,7 NIV)
To have peace of mind we must guard what we allow ourselves to dwell on.
Paul admonishes believers to think about things that are “noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, or praiseworthy.”
Oh, God, this is a scary time in my life.
Please renew my hope and give me the faith to trust you for my future.
Help me to put negative thoughts out of my mind and think on the things that will make me stronger in You.
Marlene is a retired teacher who desires to make Jesus known. Contact """^^xsd:string ;

"There is a real danger that the economic crisis that comes out of this health crisis is worse than what we experienced in 2008," Furman told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.

The former top economist to President Obama is warning the coronavirus pandemic could throw the economy into a tailspin that's significantly worse than the financial disaster in 2008 — and believes its almost certainly in recession already .

    schema:articleBody """Over the past month, you have often come across headlines such as “The markets have lost 30% off their value”, “Dow finishes down to mark worst week since 2008”, etc. Marriott CEO said this is worse than 2008 and post 9/11 combined . All such headlines trigger an immediate reaction in the minds of the average investor – Where should I put my funds so that they are safe? Even perceived safe assets like investment grade bonds and municipal bonds are under severe distress.
Amidst high panic and fear, investors tend to sell off their positions in the stock markets at losses so that the volatility of the markets doesn’t bother them. However, this loss aversion attitude in the short term leads to significant losses in the long run. Statistics have borne out that risk aversion runs higher than the greed impulse. Some estimate that the pain of losing is twice as strong an emotion than the joy of winning. To cut down their losses, investors may end up making wrong investment decisions, which can have severe repercussions in future. The stock markets are highly dynamic in nature. Every bull run leads to a bear market and there is a bull market waiting at the end of the bearish phase. Historically, the total duration of bull phase has been much higher than the bear phase. To earn profits in the stock market, the trick is to stay calm during periods of volatility. The key is to act decisively during downturns rather than being misguided by hysteria. When, the market does bottom- which it will, there will be no bell ringing the all clear.
Vanguard conducted a study to find 10-year returns of investors who adopted different strategies during the last recession of 2007 – 2009. One investor chose to sell all holdings and put their cash into savings accounts. The second investor opted for bonds while the third investor continued to hold the 50-50 stock-bond portfolio.
The cumulative returns were the highest for the third investor with investments in stocks and bonds. The initial investment of $1 million grew to $1.9 million over the 10-year period, implying an aggregate return of 90%. On the other hand, the first investor liquidated all holdings during the bearish phase. Over the 10-year period, the first investor incurred a net loss as the initial investment of $1 million was worth $729,214 only at the end. The first investor acted out of fear and incurred a net loss of 27% over the 10-year period.
Fear and panic interfere with the rational thinking and leads to decisions which can hurt significantly in the long run. Amidst volatility, the best action of an average investor is inaction. Staying calm during the bear phase would generate significant rewards in the long run. One way of keeping calmer is to have six months to a year of living expenses in cash so you don’t have to liquidate stocks or distressed bonds.
Some will choose an aggressive approach. In the words of the legendary investor Warren Buffett, “be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.” I wish I knew what Buffett was doing now. Of course, you can buy Berkshire Hathaway stock itself.
Another approach is to watch what insiders are doing with their own money. And they are buying. This is the highest level of insider buying to selling since 2008 but it has not reached that level yet. Since this current crisis is far worse, I’d wouldn’t wave the all clear until it exceeds that level. They may not have a better crystal ball about the Coronavirus than you or I, but they certainly have a better understanding of their business. That’s the basis of The Insiders Fund .
If you want to take a passive approach, investments in ETFs are also a good option. Many ETFs like the tech sector ETFs, energy sector and financial ETFs -even staid utility ETFs as well as broad market ETFs have witnessed substantial declines in price. So, start your research today. This is uncharted territory. No bear market every feels like it’s going to end, but they do- and sometimes violently to the upside.
What is important to realize is that all stocks will not march in lock stop with one another. For example, airline stocks during last Friday’s rout were mostly unchanged or even up. That’s a strong signal of a bottom in the group but one day in this new world is not sufficient enough to call a trend. Share this: """^^xsd:string ;

So demand has skyrocketed in the short term for meat products. So the common reaction would be for the price to rise. Not so with cattle prices. They where down 15 cents a pound last week and maybe even lower this week.
The order buyers are trying to tell me that the stock market is driving the price lower. I am telling them that the processors are gouging the consumer and beef producer. The price on beef in the stores has not dropped. The only down I can see is the high priced cuts going into the restaurant business has fall hard but total meat demand has shot up for now.
Just some information. At the local meat lockers to buy a quarter or half of beef the wait is 5-6 weeks. They have sold orders out that far. To get one of your own beefs processed it 4-5 month out as their schedule is full.
I am not worried as we have plenty of meat in freezers for the family.
The meat sold did not disappear. The sales of meat will crater next month as people who bought this month will be eating through it. I agree with you that growers get the short end of the stick. But it has been that way for a l ng time, and I don t see any time in the future when it will be different. Demand goes up, and we farmers fall all over ourselves to produce more.

However, that said, I gotta drive into town and go to the market. My first time actually in and among a group of total strangers in 8 days. So I’m gonna go early and hopefully beat the crowd of Sunday shoppers. (Still no known cases in Muskingum County, though.)
It’s a gorgeous day out there today, but still really cold. But it will be a pretty drive into town.
Confirmed cases are up all over the world: approximately 206,000 now. However, almost 95% of those cases are considered mild: 196,442. And we’re up to about 96,000 recoveries as of right now (3/22/2020).
And now there is that horrible earthquake thrown into the mix in Zagreb. It does indeed keep seeming Biblical out there, doesn’t it, gang?
Here, in Crazeysburg, everything is still normal. The Evangelical Community Bible church here, which is right across the road from the dollar store, has a sign out front now that says: Stock Up On Jesus.
I feel pretty confident that doing that can only help.
Well, today I’m going to continue working on the outline for In the Shadow of Narcissa, since now my main goal is to get that chapbook finished and off my desk by late Spring.
I will likely post again later this evening. Perhaps something amazing will happen at the market in town that you’ll all want to know about!
For now, I’m leaving you with this! A gem from my wee bonny although very-much-disturbed teenhood. I always took the message of this song to heart and I still do! I’m so serious. (If you weren’t aware of it, Kenny Rogers passed away yesterday at the age of 81.) Thanks for visiting, gang. I’ll be back. I love you guys. See ya!
“The Gambler”
On a warm summer’s evening On a train bound for nowhere I met up with a gambler We were both too tired to sleep So we took turns a-starin’ Out the window at the darkness The boredom overtook us And he began to speak
He said, “Son, I’ve made a life Out of readin’ people’s faces And knowin’ what the cards were By the way they held their eyes. So if you don’t mind my sayin’ I can see you’re out of aces For a taste of your whiskey I’ll give you some advice.”
So I handed him my bottle And he drank down my last swallow Then he bummed a cigarette And asked me for a light And the night got deathly quiet And his face lost all expression Said, “If you’re gonna play the game, boy, You gotta learn to play it right.
“You got to know when to hold ’em, Know when to fold ’em, Know when to walk away, And know when to run. You never count your money When you’re sittin’ at the table. There’ll be time enough for countin’ When the dealing’s done.
“Every gambler knows That the secret to survivin’ Is knowin’ what to throw away And knowin’ what to keep.‘Cause every hand’s a winner, And every hand’s a loser, And the best that you can hope for Is to die in your sleep.”
And when he finished speakin’ He turned back toward the window Crushed out his cigarette And faded off to sleep And somewhere in the darkness The gambler he broke even And in his final words I found an ace that I could keep
You got to know when to hold ’em Know when to fold ’em Know when to walk away And know when to run You never count your money When you’re sittin’ at the table There’ll be time enough for countin’ When the dealing’s done

We all know times will be tough, but i don't mind putting in extras if it gets us out of this hole in the short term, just don't destroy my wealth! Expand Over the past year our AUD has lost 21.5% vs the USD.
https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=AUD&to=USD&view=1Y
With the drought, the fires & now the Covid-19 we can expect a dramatic
reset of the stock market to reflect our impending recession. The lift over the
past few days is simply a dead cat bounce, IMO.
I walked along a cafe/resturant strip this evening of about 50-60 businesses and they were virtually empty.
One owner told me that he had already retrenched three quarters of his staff and he was relying on takeaways
now to pay the rent.
The residential hotels a few blocks away were in a similar position to the resturants and cafes ( virtually empty ) offering rooms at 60% discount!
The supermarkets seem to be the only ones benefiting at present.
The PM's announcement this PM virtually shut down pubs, clubs, resturants Cafes gyms and your normal discretionary
spend businesses. This will mean bankrupcy for many , devalue real estate and stun the economy.
The question is who will pay.? At present we have not had offers from the billionaires who have trippled their wealth since the GFC,
thanks to generous tax laws and we have had multinationals doubling their revenue in that period also and again treated very leintly
by the ATO:
https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=AUD&to=USD&view=1Y
Its now time that the Government made these multinationals pony-up and pay their fair share of tax at a time when the country is in strife.
Someone will have to pay for the $180 Billion handout package announced yesterday and unless action is taken now, it will be the unfortunate PAYE
workers who will have to pay later. This is what happened in Ireland and other European countries post the GFC which did not hit us thanks to China bailing us out with its additional demand for our exports and the accompanying high export prices.
(Pssst...we're not sending our war ships up through the China Sea now)
This time will be different, IMO, because China has been gutted already by the virus and the US Tariffs and besides China will want to support its neighbours such as Mongolia, Russis etc.
Due to our obvious pro Trump stance on China, the Chinese will be very selective this time around when it comes to the supply of raw materials to
support its own economic recovery, IMO.
IMO doubling royalties on our Iron Ore & Coal should yield about $8 billion P/A extra State Government income which would just about pay the interest only on the current Government handouts. We are already paying about $20 billion interest on the rest.
Unlike 2008, we are already loaded with soverign, state, muni, personal & business debts. If we add he lot together we're in the hole for over $7 trillion; 4 times our GDP.
With massive unemployment imminent, real estate prices are bound to tumble more than 2008/2010 which will put some recent Gen Y home owners under water, IMO.
When all this blows by this increased Government spending will have to be paid and who better than those who control our valueable mineral resources !
PS: Gold at present seems to be the best preserver of wealth!"""^^xsd:string ;

    schema:articleBody "FDA is streamlining labs to allow independent coronavirus testing after CDC showed they were just as cumbersome and incompetent as I'd worried for years, they're cutting red tape for hand sanitizer \"approval\" , getting treatments to market without 90-day comment periods where activists can insist science is a vast corporate conspiracy.What's going on? Coronavirus , that's what.The one way to show how useless most regulations are is to have a public health crisis you hope would never happen. Last month CDC literally told UC Davis they couldn't have a test to see if a patient had COVID-19 unless they first proved the patient had COVID-19 . When they finally sent tests to states, they were contaminated. How did we ever get convinced that centralized bureaucracy was the best solution to anything? That 1,000 patients in a clinical trial was not enough but 2,000 would be fine? That a change in the color of a label on a drug should require 18 months of regulatory effort? Or that a manufacturing problem in an epinephrine product should mean that the company would have to undergo registration all over again? Why not just create a standard and anyone who meets it can make it, and if they don't they get fines? Flickr, creative commons. Those blockages that prevent innovation now were not determined by public health needs, they were all politics that resulted from political theater. The same politics that led to New York spending $575,000,000 to subsidize a solar panel plant while telling scientists and doctors to create a rationing plan for the coronavirus pandemics the state had narrowly missed in 2003 and 2012 and with H1N1 in 2009. A solar panel plant in a state where it snows five months per year. Instead of buying the 16,000 ventilators experts said the state needed. Now Senator Chuck Schumer tells companies they should have been prepared for this \"rainy day\" - obviously coronavirus can be dismissed as a rainy day only when you're a wealthy politician with the world's best health care and income whether you work or not. Meanwhile, he said nothing when New York was not preparing for the disease outbreak literally everyone knew would come in. In early 2018 a team of us published The Next Plague And How Science Will Stop It (that link is to a free download of the galley, you can buy it on Amazon in print form) because we knew it was coming, it was just as matter of it would be a virus like this or an intentional act.We the public got convinced government was ready for this because things were good. When things get bad, we learn better. People get a lot more skeptical. If you want to find plenty of toilet paper, milk, and eggs today, go to Whole Foods. The minute this coronavirus crisis became real people flocked to normal food and goods. Even in my town, which got a Whole Foods when the store only put them in wealthy liberal neighborhoods, shelves are stocked. Two months ago Non-GMO Project touted how their 67,000 stickers on products led to a healthier world but now they sound absolutely tone-deaf as they continue to market fake hysteria about modern science and health in the presence of a real threat.Those of us inside science policy knew we were unprepared for anything important because we saw partisan bureaucratic creep grind the wheels of discovery and prevention to a halt. Efforts to get government science back to something close to the middle, with efforts to stop \"secret sauce\" in government panel decisions, conflicts of interest inside EPA, or streamlining drug approval so it wasn't just Big Pharma able to afford to bring products to market, We were told the people behind reform ideas hated the public and lives would be lost due to invisible pollution or a dearth of new papers linking some harmless food to some new disease.It was all nonsense, and now the public sees it. So maybe now scientists inside government the political mandate to fix itself.FDA is loosening the stranglehold on hand sanitizer approval because people are making it themselves. That shows you how little government regulatory hammers decided by politicians are needed. A bureaucracy that allows $30 billion in supplement claims and $100 billion in organic food claims that it is \"healthier\" has kept the public from having clean hands .Regulatory reform motivation that may come of this won't last forever, bureaucratic creep is a fungus that only stops growing until times are good again, but the pro-science public should stop complaining about the other political party and demand real reform of the institution itself.More about SARS-CoV-2, the 2019 form of coronavirus, and the COVID-19 disease it causes:"^^xsd:string ;

So the common reaction would be for the price to rise. Not so with cattle prices. They where down 15 cents a pound last week and maybe even lower this week.
The order buyers are trying to tell me that the stock market is driving the price lower. I am telling them that the processors are gouging the consumer and beef producer. The price on beef in the stores has not dropped. The only down I can see is the high priced cuts going into the restaurant business has fall hard but total meat demand has shot up for now.
Just some information. At the local meat lockers to buy a quarter or half of beef the wait is 5-6 weeks. They have sold orders out that far. To get one of your own beefs processed it 4-5 month out as their schedule is full.
I am not worried as we have plenty of meat in freezers for the family."""^^xsd:string ;

Malaysia government should be responsible to help all business and ordinary Malaysian to face the challenge. It is government responsibility to protect our benefits .
Other countries have more progressive stimulus plan like USA
GERMANY, CANADA and few more countries, RM600 simply not enough imagine how a family of 4 or 5 can rely on just RM600 for 2 weeks . Please be remember that at least 70 percent and more donot have enought saving to encounter such RMO losses . Those person in Malay phrase “kais pagi makan pagi , kais petang makan petang”. Malaysia should hold responsibility to protect Malaysian from the disaster called coronavirus COVID-19.
Malaysia is well known as a welfare state , so I really conffident and believe government have the ability to give a hand to those who need the government help nor matter it is individual , organisation , or business.
Malaysia government can implement following action to help our beloves Malaysian
1. Provide atleast RM 1200 to all Malaysian who losses their job such as tourist guide , bus driver, shop retailer , hawker ,oil industry and entertainment.
2. Provide low interest loan to all business .
3. Lower the income tax of M40 and B40.
4. Lower the company tax.
5.Give higher special elaun to frontliner RM500 per person because they risk themselves to fight the desease. Some doctor and nurse work 14 hours a day to cope with patient.
6. Provide at least 20 billion economic stimulus plan because our stock market is down drastically and our currency values also down.
7. Allow EPF contributer to take out some of the money to pay their bill.
8. Lower the electricity bill and water bill by atleast 20 percent. (international fuel prices decrease drastically since last year)
9.Provide free consultant to all workers and business that face difficulty.
10. If really cannot provide free tertiary education for our sons, government should atleast reduce the tuition fee for all Malaysian in IPTA and IPTS.
Government should reduce our burden not to increase it. I know Malaysian will have a hard time to go through because Brent crude oil is now under 30 dollar a tong government revenue will reduce atleast 20 billions Ringgit Malaysia if I am not mistaken. Tourism industry also damage by COVID-19 . Ringgit Malaysia plunged to its lowest level since 2017 as US Dollar indicator rise to its highest level level since 2008 financial crisis. Next financial crisis will come soon , Malaysia government please be prepared to protect Malaysian from the chaos. Thanks."""^^xsd:string ;

    schema:articleBody """Ugh. Covid 19 and it’s associated market uncertainties have resulted in a suspension of our search to buy property at this time. Granted rates are low but so is inventory and the stock market. My poor 401k has taken a beating. Nevertheless, I am grateful to so far only have these relatively minor financial impacts. SO and I are both still able to work as normal and I know that’s a blessing.
I’ve given notice to my current barn. Nice time right? But since I won’t be moving him home anytime soon it seems, I need a different boarding situation. I’ve found a lovely facility quite close to home that offers a lovely array of amenities and services. My only concern is the turn out. The turn outs are impeccably fenced and maintained with an abundance of space and excellent grass. However the BO will not consider over night turn out. Horses are turned out all day every day bar thunderstorms or excessive heat. We live in FL so excessive heat is every day in the summer. During the summer horses go out half a day in the morning. BO is willing to accommodate my desire for extra turn out by also turning my boy out after pm feed around 5/6 until night check around 930. The stalls are traditional boxes, no attached paddock/run. Stalls are matted and bedded to a depth of @ 4”. I am unsure if it is concrete or clay under mats. I’m concerned about him standing in the stall so much. His physical and mental health are of course very important to me. I know that a lot of horses get less turn out. What say you COTHers? Is this adequate turnout? There is another farm a little further away that offers a more customizable turn out schedule up to 24/7 outside. But it is much busier and other aspects of care, while solid are not as customizable as my first choice.
First choice barn also offers blanketing, boots, fly spray, fly mask on and off daily to my specifications included in cost. Also offers ability to supply my own feed of choice for an appropriate discount on board cost. BO states that her philosophy is horses should always have something to chew and feeds 4-5 flakes of hay in stalls on average and is willing to use my porta grazer in stall. I believe this enough hay for him to always have it in front of him. All stalls have exterior windows and half doors to center aisle that horses can put head through. So he would be able to look out front and back of stall. Two high velocity fans and three 5 gal water buckets in stalls. Would your horse be comfortable standing in this stall 15-18 hours a day? Am I being overly worried? I’m stressing out here!"""^^xsd:string ;

Global Financial System Broken & Bankrupt
Greg Hunter
Financial and precious metals expert Egon von Greyerz (EvG) operates the largest private gold vault in the world in Switzerland. More than a year and a half ago, EvG warned here on USAWatchdog.com that “risk is exponential and unmeasurable” because of the estimated two quadrillion of derivatives and debt in the global financial system. He also warned that “at some point, all hell will break loose.” Looks like hell has indeed broken loose because of the China virus, and now EvG contends, “The system is bankrupt. . . . The system is broken and bankrupt.
This did not start now with the Coronavirus. It didn’t start in August and September (of 2019) when central banks said we would do everything we can with the Fed QE, repos and the ECB (European Central Bank) QE. . . . This started a long time ago. The system was broken at the beginning of this century. The 2007-2009 crisis was the first signal that the financial system was not functioning. They threw $25 trillion at it in financing and guarantees, etc., but I always said 2007-2009 was a rehearsal. We are now approaching, sadly, the real thing. This is the end of a two to three hundred year cycle. So, we are going to see some extremely difficult times. The Corona virus is a horrible catalyst, but that is all it is. It’s not the reason for the problem. The reason for the problem is a broken financial system . . . and now we are starting the final stage of the end of this financial system.”
EvG also says the reaction to the China virus is the same worldwide. EvG says, “You are seeing food shops with empty shelves. People are panicking. So, that is the first reaction to the Coronavirus, but they have not realized the big problem is in the financial markets. It is in a system that has no liquidity or money, and it has to print more and more. At some point, people will realize there is no money, and you will have the same reaction. People will be lining up outside of banks or they will go to their ATM machines to get money and, of course, they will have to reduce it. Now, in most countries, there is no cash. So, it is easy for them to shut off the system. There will absolutely be shortages of cash for people, otherwise, you will have bank runs.”
EvG contends, “They have managed to maintain totally false markets with no real price discovery, certainly since 2009, by just flooding the market with so much money. We don’t have any real markets. We don’t have any real prices. It’s all fake. It’s all fake because it’s all supported by fake money.”
EvG also predicts that before it’s over, the stock market will be down 90% or more. EvG says, “In 1929, the market crash took 2 ½ years to go down 90%. The bubble is much bigger now, so it could go very, very fast. . . . The risk is at a level now where the world cannot be saved.”

https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=AUD&to=USD&view=1Y
With the drought, the fires & now the Covid-19 we can expect a dramatic
reset of the stock market to reflect our impending recession. The lift over the
past few days is simply a dead cat bounce, IMO.
I walked along a cafe/resturant strip this evening of about 50-60 businesses and they were virtually empty.
One owner told me that he had already retrenched three quarters of his staff and he was relying on takeaways
now to pay the rent.
The residential hotels a few blocks away were in a similar position to the resturants and cafes ( virtually empty ) offering rooms at 60% discount!
The supermarkets seem to be the only ones benefiting at present.
The PM's announcement this PM virtually shut down pubs, clubs, resturants Cafes gyms and your normal discretionary
spend businesses. This will mean bankrupcy for many , devalue real estate and stun the economy.
The question is who will pay.? At present we have not had offers from the billionaires who have trippled their wealth since the GFC,
thanks to generous tax laws and we have had multinationals doubling their revenue in that period also and again treated very leintly
by the ATO:
https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=AUD&to=USD&view=1Y
Its now time that the Government made these multinationals pony-up and pay their fair share of tax at a time when the country is in strife.
Someone will have to pay for the $180 Billion handout package announced yesterday and unless action is taken now, it will be the unfortunate PAYE
workers who will have to pay later. This is what happened in Ireland and other European countries post the GFC which did not hit us thanks to China bailing us out with its additional demand for our exports and the accompanying high export prices.
(Pssst...we're not sending our war ships up through the China Sea now)
This time will be different, IMO, because China has been gutted already by the virus and the US Tariffs and besides China will want to support its neighbours such as Mongolia, Russis etc.
Due to our obvious pro Trump stance on China, the Chinese will be very selective this time around when it comes to the supply of raw materials to
support its own economic recovery, IMO.
IMO doubling royalties on our Iron Ore & Coal should yield about $8 billion P/A extra State Government income which would just about pay the interest only on the current Government handouts. We are already paying about $20 billion interest on the rest.
Unlike 2008, we are already loaded with soverign, state, muni, personal & business debts. If we add he lot together we're in the hole for over $7 trillion; 4 times our GDP.
With massive unemployment imminent, real estate prices are bound to tumble more than 2008/2010 which will put some recent Gen Y home owners under water, IMO.
When all this blows by this increased Government spending will have to be paid and who better than those who control our valueable mineral resources !
PS: Gold at present seems to be the best preserver of wealth! Expand Yes it's gloomy
extent
no one knows.
People have to live in buildings
eat, crap, use water elec and gas
The government has panicked
maybe they know something.
The plug has been pulled from the
power point.
