    schema:articleBody """In 1933, as Franklin D. Roosevelt took his oath of office as the 32nd President of the United States, his people were hurting. From Texas to Detroit to every state in between, citizens were struggling through a 25% unemployment rate, a series of natural disasters, widespread housing foreclosures and food shortages, a stock market that had tumbled by 90%, and little hope for recovery as the Great Depression took hold. Directed by gifted filmmaker Robert Stone, The Civilian Conservation Corps outlines one of the most daring and consequential of the public programs enacted by Roosevelt during this time, a tenant of the New Deal that continues to resonate in our modern world.
Up until that time, the public did not necessarily look upon the government as an engine for bettering their daily lives. Roosevelt's New Deal restructured the function of the government in an unprecedented manner. As part of this string of new programs, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was designed to reward meaningful work while improving upon the environmental vitality of the nation. Toiling over a period of six months in labor camps across the country, program participants were paid a daily wage to plant trees, repair gullies and embark on other conversation projects. This was many years before environmentalism became one of the country's chief movements.
Roosevelt looked upon the program as a win-win proposition; these efforts would enhance the value of the country's natural resources while keeping its most vulnerable citizens employed. Nevertheless, a vocal opposition did emerge, and blasted the president for ignoring the interests of business, deficit spending and corporate taxes.
The story of the CCC is vividly captured through a wealth of impressive archived materials and a series of new interviews with the men who signed up for the program up until the time of its demise in 1942. The narrative they weave is one of pride, prosperity and patriotism.
The Civilian Conservation Corps is a beautifully assembled and meticulously rendered slice of American history. But it is by no means a dry history lesson; instead, it makes this long-passed era feel personal and inspirational.

    schema:articleBody """Since February 19, stock markets have been falling, with the series of roller coaster sessions leaving investors reeling. In the last two weeks, markets fell in six out of ten trading sessions, and the drops were larger than the gains. The S&P 500 finished Friday’s trading session down by 4.4%, and hit a three-year low.
Falling markets, however difficult they may be for traders’ portfolio values and companies’ market caps, can be accommodated. Investors can get used to lower stock prices, or can switch to bearish strategies to cope. The bigger question now is, will the economy as a whole get pushed into a recession, and if so, how long will it last?
These questions are urgent. Goldman Sachs is sounding a red alert, warning of a possible 24% contraction in the US economy for Q2 2020. Not every business sector lends itself to remote work, and those workers don’t have the opportunity now to go out and spend – while the services supported and provided by ‘nonessential workers’ are shutting down. Coronavirus may not be a particularly dangerous disease for everyone, but it’s clearly having an enormous impact.
Impact, however, does not have to mean irreparable damage. You can rescue your portfolio, with some judicious stock choices. We’ve used the TipRanks Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool to find out which stocks the market’s insiders are snapping up, with a view to the long-term and the post-coronavirus recovery. Here are three of their favorite choices.
Fed E x Corporation ( FDX )
Government-ordered shutdowns and quarantines are hurting FedEx for the obvious reasons. The shipping company is seeing less business – stores are ordering less stock, people facing layoffs are placing fewer online orders. As manufacturing begins to return in Asia, conditions are worsening in Europe. Uncertainty is the word of the day for FedEx.
The company’s fiscal Q3 report, covering the period ending February 29, showed a miss on earnings. The $1.41 reported was 5.4% below the $1.49 expected, and less than half the $3.03 shown in the year-ago quarter. Revenues did better, as the $17.5 billion reported was up 2.8% from the year before. The strong revenues reassured investors, and the stock gained after the report; nevertheless, FDX shares are down 27% so far this year.
On a positive note, FDX has kept its 18-year record of reliable dividend payments. The company maintained its 65-cent quarterly payment, announced on March 6 and due out on April 1. The annualized payment of $2.60 gives a yield of 2.34%, higher than the ~2% average among S&P listed peer companies – and far higher than bond yields.
Additionally, at least one insider is bullish on FDX. Board of Directors member John Edwardson has been snapping up shares for the last six months – and his most recent purchase, just last week, was significant to say the least– he shelled out $560,200 for 5,000 shares. This brings his total holding in FedEx to more than 82,000 shares, worth over $9 million. Clearly, Edwardson sees the advantages outweighing the negatives here.
Some of Wall Street’s top analysts would agree. Writing for Cowen, 5-star analyst Helane Becker sees long-term benefits for FedEx: “Social distancing is accelerating the growth of ecommerce, a trend FedEx is well positioned to benefit from. The continued restriction of passenger air travel to certain regions has resulted in reduced belly capacity, leaving an opening for shippers like FedEx to grab share… the company notes Asia manufacturing has started to come back, which should drive increased demand for FedEx's international export service…”
Becker shows some caution by reducing her price target to $156, but still sees an impressive 40% upside potential for the coming year, and maintains her Buy rating on the stock. (To watch Becker’s track record, click here )
Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry , also rated 5-stars by TipRanks, is more bullish, backing her Buy rating with a price target of $159 – suggesting an upside of 43%. (To watch Landry’s track record, click here )"""^^xsd:string ;

Separately, NSE and BSE also said all segments at the exchanges will operate as usual on Monday.
The clarifications came amid market talk that the regulator was looking at shorter working hours amid rising coronavirus cases in financial capital Mumbai, which is in a lockdown until at least March 31.
Earlier in the day, one business TV channel reported Sebi and the Finance Ministry were discussing cutting down market hours during lockdown, and were evaluating the final option of keeping stock markets shut.
The report said that if the stock markets are to be shut down temporarily, the expiry date of futures and options contracts could be preponed.
The Maharashtra government on Sunday said Section 144 of CrPC, which prohibits gathering of over five persons at public places, is being imposed in the state to contain the spread of coronavirus.
Making the announcement, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the measure was being taken in urban areas across the state from Monday to ensure social distancing.
The total number coronavirus cases in India surged to 341 at the time of writing of this report. Five of the ten people, who tested positive for the coronavirus in Maharashtra on Sunday, got the infection through local transmission, state Health Minister Rajesh Tope said.
The Centre and state governments decided to completely lock down 75 districts across the country where coronavirus cases have been reported, officials said on Sunday.
The districts where lockdown was announced are from states that include Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It has also been decided that all trains will be stopped till March 31, and no Metro rail and inter-state buses will operate till month end"""^^xsd:string ;

    schema:articleBody """Over the past month, you have often come across headlines such as “The markets have lost 30% off their value”, “Dow finishes down to mark worst week since 2008”, etc. Marriott CEO said this is worse than 2008 and post 9/11 combined . All such headlines trigger an immediate reaction in the minds of the average investor – Where should I put my funds so that they are safe? Even perceived safe assets like investment grade bonds and municipal bonds are under severe distress.
Amidst high panic and fear, investors tend to sell off their positions in the stock markets at losses so that the volatility of the markets doesn’t bother them. However, this loss aversion attitude in the short term leads to significant losses in the long run. Statistics have borne out that risk aversion runs higher than the greed impulse. Some estimate that the pain of losing is twice as strong an emotion than the joy of winning. To cut down their losses, investors may end up making wrong investment decisions, which can have severe repercussions in future. The stock markets are highly dynamic in nature. Every bull run leads to a bear market and there is a bull market waiting at the end of the bearish phase. Historically, the total duration of bull phase has been much higher than the bear phase. To earn profits in the stock market, the trick is to stay calm during periods of volatility. The key is to act decisively during downturns rather than being misguided by hysteria. When, the market does bottom- which it will, there will be no bell ringing the all clear.
Vanguard conducted a study to find 10-year returns of investors who adopted different strategies during the last recession of 2007 – 2009. One investor chose to sell all holdings and put their cash into savings accounts. The second investor opted for bonds while the third investor continued to hold the 50-50 stock-bond portfolio.
The cumulative returns were the highest for the third investor with investments in stocks and bonds. The initial investment of $1 million grew to $1.9 million over the 10-year period, implying an aggregate return of 90%. On the other hand, the first investor liquidated all holdings during the bearish phase. Over the 10-year period, the first investor incurred a net loss as the initial investment of $1 million was worth $729,214 only at the end. The first investor acted out of fear and incurred a net loss of 27% over the 10-year period.
Fear and panic interfere with the rational thinking and leads to decisions which can hurt significantly in the long run. Amidst volatility, the best action of an average investor is inaction. Staying calm during the bear phase would generate significant rewards in the long run. One way of keeping calmer is to have six months to a year of living expenses in cash so you don’t have to liquidate stocks or distressed bonds.
Some will choose an aggressive approach. In the words of the legendary investor Warren Buffett, “be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.” I wish I knew what Buffett was doing now. Of course, you can buy Berkshire Hathaway stock itself.
Another approach is to watch what insiders are doing with their own money. And they are buying. This is the highest level of insider buying to selling since 2008 but it has not reached that level yet. Since this current crisis is far worse, I’d wouldn’t wave the all clear until it exceeds that level. They may not have a better crystal ball about the Coronavirus than you or I, but they certainly have a better understanding of their business. That’s the basis of The Insiders Fund .
If you want to take a passive approach, investments in ETFs are also a good option. Many ETFs like the tech sector ETFs, energy sector and financial ETFs -even staid utility ETFs as well as broad market ETFs have witnessed substantial declines in price. So, start your research today. This is uncharted territory. No bear market every feels like it’s going to end, but they do- and sometimes violently to the upside.
What is important to realize is that all stocks will not march in lock stop with one another. For example, airline stocks during last Friday’s rout were mostly unchanged or even up. That’s a strong signal of a bottom in the group but one day in this new world is not sufficient enough to call a trend. Share this: """^^xsd:string ;

    schema:articleBody "FDA is streamlining labs to allow independent coronavirus testing after CDC showed they were just as cumbersome and incompetent as I'd worried for years, they're cutting red tape for hand sanitizer \"approval\" , getting treatments to market without 90-day comment periods where activists can insist science is a vast corporate conspiracy.What's going on? Coronavirus , that's what.The one way to show how useless most regulations are is to have a public health crisis you hope would never happen. Last month CDC literally told UC Davis they couldn't have a test to see if a patient had COVID-19 unless they first proved the patient had COVID-19 . When they finally sent tests to states, they were contaminated. How did we ever get convinced that centralized bureaucracy was the best solution to anything? That 1,000 patients in a clinical trial was not enough but 2,000 would be fine? That a change in the color of a label on a drug should require 18 months of regulatory effort? Or that a manufacturing problem in an epinephrine product should mean that the company would have to undergo registration all over again? Why not just create a standard and anyone who meets it can make it, and if they don't they get fines? Flickr, creative commons. Those blockages that prevent innovation now were not determined by public health needs, they were all politics that resulted from political theater. The same politics that led to New York spending $575,000,000 to subsidize a solar panel plant while telling scientists and doctors to create a rationing plan for the coronavirus pandemics the state had narrowly missed in 2003 and 2012 and with H1N1 in 2009. A solar panel plant in a state where it snows five months per year. Instead of buying the 16,000 ventilators experts said the state needed. Now Senator Chuck Schumer tells companies they should have been prepared for this \"rainy day\" - obviously coronavirus can be dismissed as a rainy day only when you're a wealthy politician with the world's best health care and income whether you work or not. Meanwhile, he said nothing when New York was not preparing for the disease outbreak literally everyone knew would come in. In early 2018 a team of us published The Next Plague And How Science Will Stop It (that link is to a free download of the galley, you can buy it on Amazon in print form) because we knew it was coming, it was just as matter of it would be a virus like this or an intentional act.We the public got convinced government was ready for this because things were good. When things get bad, we learn better. People get a lot more skeptical. If you want to find plenty of toilet paper, milk, and eggs today, go to Whole Foods. The minute this coronavirus crisis became real people flocked to normal food and goods. Even in my town, which got a Whole Foods when the store only put them in wealthy liberal neighborhoods, shelves are stocked. Two months ago Non-GMO Project touted how their 67,000 stickers on products led to a healthier world but now they sound absolutely tone-deaf as they continue to market fake hysteria about modern science and health in the presence of a real threat.Those of us inside science policy knew we were unprepared for anything important because we saw partisan bureaucratic creep grind the wheels of discovery and prevention to a halt. Efforts to get government science back to something close to the middle, with efforts to stop \"secret sauce\" in government panel decisions, conflicts of interest inside EPA, or streamlining drug approval so it wasn't just Big Pharma able to afford to bring products to market, We were told the people behind reform ideas hated the public and lives would be lost due to invisible pollution or a dearth of new papers linking some harmless food to some new disease.It was all nonsense, and now the public sees it. So maybe now scientists inside government the political mandate to fix itself.FDA is loosening the stranglehold on hand sanitizer approval because people are making it themselves. That shows you how little government regulatory hammers decided by politicians are needed. A bureaucracy that allows $30 billion in supplement claims and $100 billion in organic food claims that it is \"healthier\" has kept the public from having clean hands .Regulatory reform motivation that may come of this won't last forever, bureaucratic creep is a fungus that only stops growing until times are good again, but the pro-science public should stop complaining about the other political party and demand real reform of the institution itself.More about SARS-CoV-2, the 2019 form of coronavirus, and the COVID-19 disease it causes:"^^xsd:string ;
