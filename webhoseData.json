      "text": "Plant based burger as fake meat or vegan hamburger representing a vegetarian protien in a 3D illustration style.\nHave you seen it yet?\nIf you have, and you’re thinking you’ve got to ‘go vegan’ as the main takeaway, it’s worth considering whether all the information presented should be taken at face value, or if, just perhaps, some of it may have been taken just a tad out of context.\nThe latest in a series of documentaries, many of which contain scientific backing and sound research, Game Changers, is “a revolutionary new film about meat, protein and strength”, and “tells the story of James Wilks, elite Special Forces trainer and The Ultimate Fighter winner, as he travels the world on a quest to uncover the optimal diet for human performance. Showcasing elite athletes, special ops soldiers, visionary scientists, cultural icons, and everyday heroes, what James discovers permanently changes his understanding of food and his definition of true strength.” (1)\nThe film and the website, both extremely well produced and presented, give a host of reasons why ‘eating meat is bad’ including the old go-to that ‘meat causes cancer’, that animal products create inflammation in humans, and that livestock require excessive land because animals are actually just the “middlemen,” consuming on average six times more protein than they even produce.\nAnd that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\nNow all those things are relatively true… if we’re talking about beef sourced from inhumane stock yards, chicken from deplorable battery-cage production facilities stacked as high as the ceiling who never see the light of day, and pigs stuffed into pens so small they cannot turn around.\nNone of these practices are acceptable and as a starting point, should never be supported in any manner.\nAdd to that, the way in which our common foods are packaged and processed, then served to us in giant portions on a platter; or a to-go bags from many of the nearly quarter of a million fast food eateries that existed as of 2018. (2)\nPreservatives are added to allow a longer shelf life. Sugars are also added to cater to the cloyingly sweet palate so many Americans have unknowingly created for themselves after a lifetime of including the white powder as part of their ‘everything in moderation’ directive. Finally, there’s the FDA approved colors and stabilizers. What ends up in our greasy burger, wrapped in paper, is certainly far from anything that should be a part of what any of us eat regularly, if ever.\nBut what about properly sourced animal-based products, eaten in the proper quantities (as in small to moderate), balanced with a plethora of local, in season veggies, fruits and ample natural fats?\nThat’s a horse of a different color.\nBelow are ten reasons why ‘going vegan’ after watching this film—or for any other reason, for that matter—isn’t necessarily the best course of action.\n1. Proper Sourcing of Animal Products Benefits the Environment\nWhen properly managed, raising animals on pasture instead of factory farms is a net benefit to the environment. To begin with, a diet of grazed grass requires much less fossil fuel than a feedlot diet of dried corn and soy. On pasture, grazing animals do their own fertilizing and harvesting. The ground is covered with greens all year round, so it does an excellent job of harvesting solar energy and holding on to top-soil and moisture. As you will read in the bulletins below, grazed pasture removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere more effectively than any land use, including forestland and un-grazed prairie, helping to slow global warming. (3) 2. Portions\nMeat, eggs, and dairy products from pastured animals are ideal for your health. Compared with commercial products, they offer you more “good” fats, and fewer “bad” fats. They are richer in antioxidants including vitamins E, beta-carotene, and vitamin C. Furthermore, they do not contain traces of added hormones, antibiotics or other drugs. At one point in Game Changers a group of three pro ball players were interviewed; two of whom regularly ate excessive portions of steak or fried chicken as part of their pre-game meal. The third was vegetarian, and often ate a bean and cheese burrito. Not only was the sourcing of the proteins sub-par for the first two, at-best, the sheer size of the steak was enough to feed four athletes. For comparison, a pre-game meal for a large man, consisting of 4-6 ounces of grass fed and finished rib eye, paired with a large arugula, avocado and olive oil salad, a large portion of steamed broccoli with fresh lime, and six ounces of baked yam would provide ample carbohydrate, fat and protein, a high level of nutrient density, fiber and a net alkaline load on the body. This meal would set the athlete up for proper digestion and assimilation; just what is needed to perform at a high level, not solely in sport but also in daily life. 3. Plant Based Needn’t Mean Vegan\nWhoever decided that a plant-based diet and moderate portions of mindfully sourced proteins cannot be one and the same? I consider the way I eat and the way I feed my family, including our 7-month old son, to be plant based. If over 80% of what we are eating is local, in season, organic veggies and a little bit of fruit, how could it be classified as anything else? When we portion our meat properly, and not in the greedy manner we’ve grown accustomed to, we are, in fact, plant-based and treating our body and our planet respectfully. 4. Vegan-Labeled Food Isn’t Necessarily Healthy\nAny diet that one may choose to follow can be taken out of context, even if it is based on sound principles. We saw it with gluten-free, then Paleo and now keto. An authentic Paleo Diet, which mimics the foods our ancestors ate using readily available foods we can source in our modern day society from our farmer’s markets and our own backyards, is a far cry from a grocery cart full of Paleo-labeled pancakes, breads, cookies, and pasta. If what one gleans from this film—or other documentaries like it including What the Health or Forks over Knives —is just to nix any animal products, then all they are doing is taking a lateral step in terms of the net inflammation in the body. If it’s in a package, it’s quite likely to be highly processed and low or completely lacking in nutrient density. 5. Vegan Food Production Can Also Be Toxic to Our Planet\nSoy crops rob the soil of nutrients without giving back. They’re one of the most pesticide laden crops and they are now almost all genetically modified. The major part of it goes to feed livestock, who get sick eating it. Some factory produced cuts of meat are now injected with extra soy. This is yet another reason to stay clear of factory-farmed animals: save yourself and the environment from soy.\nMonsanto, the largest soy producer now sues every farmer who gets their soy cross-pollinated by Monsanto’s patented GMO crops. Cross-pollination used to be the way plants reproduced, now it’s illegal! It should actually be the opposite, where the farmers sue Monsanto for infecting their crops, but of course Monsanto is now too big to be vulnerable. They have very strong political power because of the lobbying they do. (4)\nAnd that’s just the part we ingest. It is also packaged in plastic waste which is collected for recycling and shipped to Indonesia. There, some is burned as fuel by tofu makers, producing deadly chemicals and contaminating food. (5) 6. Vegan Diets Can Also Create Inflammation\nIt’s not only poorly sourced meat, dairy and poultry that can create inflammation in the body; grains, beans, vegetable oils, and some nuts and seeds, can also do an excellent job. Naturally occurring substances known as anti-nutrients, including saponins, lectins or phytates, found in plant-derived foods, interfere with absorption and/or the proper functioning of nutrients in the body.\nAnti-nutrients are compounds that are produced by plants as part of their defense mechanism. They are very resistant to digestion and consequently, stay intact in our gut and, in turn, can have a damaging effect. Not only do they bind to nutrients in our healthy food options, decreasing the nutrient value of those foods, they can increase gut permeability as well as bind receptors in the gut. Both mechanisms allow these antinutrients to cross the gut barrier and get systemic access, something that should not happen. This then leads to a multitude of symptoms that can manifest throughout the body, ranging from headaches, mental fogginess, joint pain, and the onset or exacerbation of autoimmune conditions…just to list a handful of the maladies that can ensue. (6) 7. Small Amounts of Mindfully Sourced, Natural Proteins Are an Essential Component of a Healthy Human Diet\nStudies show that the modern human brain consumes 20 percent of the body’s energy at rest; twice that of other primates. Historically, meat and cooked foods were needed to provide the necessary calorie boost to feed a growing brain. Meat must have been an integral, and not sporadic, element of the pre-human diet more than one-million years ago. (7) 8. Properly Sourced Animal Foods Play A Crucial Role in A Baby’s First Foods\nAnimal-sourced zinc stimulates healthier bones and low zinc stunts growth. Vegan children, especially boys, tend to be shorter because getting enough zinc from birth through age five can metabolically program your child’s height. In addition, higher zinc levels lead to improved cognitive development. In one study, researchers compared adding meat or iron fortified cereal to exclusively breast-fed infants and found that the meat-fed infants had substantially higher rate of brain growth and demonstrated trends towards other advanced developmental advantages. (8) 9. Performance on the Field / Performance in Life Also Depends on Our Genetics, and It’s Not One Size Fits All\nWe’re all individuals. The idea that all humans should eat exactly the same way makes about as much sense as the idea that every woman across the world should have a menstrual cycle that lasts exactly 28 days all the time. If we begin by taking a look-back to a few generations earlier, we can see what our own genetics would likely predispose us to. And while certain populations certainly tend to have a more meat-based diet and others a more plant-based diet, if we go back a hundred years or so, you can rest assured that most people were not going out of their way to avoid any and all meat and animal products as a means to prevent heart disease or keep their blood sugar from climbing up even further to the pre-diabetic range. They ate locally, seasonally and fresh. They ate food. It was only in the past 75 years or so that food began to become an industry; a hugely profitable giant. If we do nothing else, just by taking a moment to see what our own families ate, we can see how that compares to what we’re eating now and make small changes to mimic what they did. 10. Here’s an Idea: What if We Nixed All the Labeling and Just Ate Food?\nI always find it interesting to learn all the new ways we choose to label the way in which we eat. Pesco-vegetarian. Pegan. Part-time vegan. Weekend Paleo. What if we just dialed it way back to tuning into what food really is: food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism’s cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. (9) Confused and overwhelmed about how to decipher confusing labels? Choose things that do not come in a package with a label. There’s no doubting what’s in a bunch of kale or an avocado!\nSumming It up…\nUndoubtedly, documentaries of this nature do a great job at raising awareness and granted, if someone following the Standard American Diet makes positive shifts as a result, that’s fantastic.\nBut to eschew all animal products regardless of where they’re sourced, how much we eat, and in what manner they’re prepared isn’t the straightforward answer one might think if they walk away from the film without mulling over some of the points shared above.",

      "text": "March 22, 2020 | Leave a comment | Home The best Side of best order fulfillment For eCommerce startups, success strategy is a transferring goal. If you begin out small, your first fulfillment warehouse could also be your spare bed room or storage. As you develop, you would possibly lease warehouse area and hire staff to choose, pack, and ship your orders. Eventually, you’ll in all probability outsource your storage and shipping to a fulfillment warehouse.Once you select your fulfillment provider, an important consideration is location. You want success warehouses close enough to your prospects to get your merchandise delivered shortly. But you don’t need to unfold your products among too many warehouses, or your inventory value can go up.Here's a guide to help you develop your fulfillment warehouse plan.Success Warehouse MethodsWhen you are first getting began, working with a single fulfillment center could also be all you'll be able to handle. Placing methods in place can all be a big carry if you find yourself new to eCommerce. In addition, it can be hard to separate your inventory between a number of warehouses until you establish gross sales patterns. If you determine that a single fulfillment warehouse is the only option for you, you don’t have to decide on a local 3PL supplier. A fulfillment middle that’s close to your clients will serve what you are promoting better than one that’s near you.As your corporation grows, nonetheless, you will most likely want to place your inventory in a number of warehouses. Once your small business matures, you'll find that there are massive upsides to splitting your stock between two or extra nationwide success warehouses. Where Are Your Clients?Your multi-location fulfillment warehouse technique will largely depend on where your clients are. Let’s begin with a hypothetical example. Toni runs Tropical Treats Candy Firm out of a commercial building in Miami, Florida. At first, Toni sells her chocolate treats to local shops. Then she strikes into eCommerce and begins to ship orders. She expects that almost all of her customers will probably be in Florida however good opinions shortly unfold the word about her Macadamia Nut Shock and Choco-Mango Madness. Before lengthy, people across the United States are clamoring for her candy treats.Site visitors on Toni’s site is up, however so is her shopping cart abandonment price. She gets comments about her candy being “worth the wait.” Toni realizes that high shipping costs and lengthy supply times could be costing her sales. That might be fatal to her rising eCommerce candy business. She wants a different technique to get candy to her hungry followers.Her workers have been delivery orders immediately from her production facility. However, they'll’t deal with the quantity anymore. Toni realizes that a achievement warehouse in Miami won’t clear up her success downside. She needs to search for a centrally-located success warehouse. She wants a 3PL service supplier that has warehouses serving both coasts and the center of the nation. That’s one of the best ways to get her candies to her prospects shortly. A multi-success warehouse technique is particularly important for Toni’s enterprise, since her products have a restricted shelf life.Map where your eCommerce orders are delivered. Are your prospects clustered in certain areas or unfold out evenly across the nation? Answers to those questions will show you how to determine the very best achievement warehouse locations for your business.Achievement Warehouse Location and Supply TimeDelivery that takes per week or extra may be acceptable in case you have a lock on a distinct segment market. However, lengthy ship instances can value you gross sales, especially in the event you sell on one of many big platforms. If you’re on Amazon or eBay or compete with those platforms, fast supply is a should.ECommerce consumers deal with on-line shopping not much otherwise than going to the website store. They want to order one day and receive their order within a few days. That is particularly true for online businesses that promote on a regular basis requirements. When customers purchase the kinds of goods buyers as soon as purchased at grocery or normal retailer on-line, they want it fast. ECommerce is moving closer to offering shoppers the satisfaction of getting a purchase immediately. As traditional, Amazon leads the development with one-day and even similar-day delivery. In the longer term, an Amazon drone could drop off your buy inside a few hours.One Success Supplier’s Multi-Warehouse TechniqueAt Pink Stag Success, we established our first success warehouse exterior of Knoxville, Tennessee. From there, we are able to ship our shoppers’ orders to virtually every location east of the Rockies within two business days. As our fulfillment enterprise grew, we realized we wanted to have the ability to ship orders to the entire country more quickly.We selected Salt Lake Metropolis, Utah as the placement of our second warehouse. From those two locations, Red Stag Fulfillment can now ship orders ninety seven% of the continental United States inside two days. With just two strategically-placed fulfillment warehouses, we are able to ship faster, cheaper shipping for our purchasers. At Pink Stag, we work with every client to develop the best success technique for their eCommerce enterprise.To see how such a technique works in action, let’s look at an instance. Charlie in Charleston needs to get a make-up reward to his lengthy-distance sweetie in Seattle. He’s going to decide on the company that may ship an enormous box of “I’m sorry” sweets the fastest. Now that Toni has bi-coastal fulfillment, Charlie is extra probably to choose her Tropical Treats. Her fast delivery provides her an edge over her competitors. The West Coast warehouse of her 3PL firm can get it to Susan in Seattle the subsequent day. Now everyone seems to be happy.A number of Fulfillment Warehouses and Delivery PricesFree delivery is the favourite choice of web shoppers. Affordable transport costs most likely won’t kill your gross sales. However, delivery prices that add significantly to the cost of ordering on-line can end your probability at a sale. UPS and FedEx base their transport rates, at the very least in part, on zone. The larger the gap between your fulfillment warehouse and your customer, the more zones your bundle will have to cross. Meaning a better transport cost. This can be a large good thing about using a 3PL company with bi-coastal warehouses. Each order can ship from the situation closest to the shopper. You save on transport and the customer gets the order faster.Dividing Your InventoryThere is a value to utilizing a couple of warehouse. You'll need to ship your inventory in bulk to two places to inventory both warehouses. But the fee per unit to ship pallets on a cross-nation truck is greater than offset by what you save on shipping. The delivery cost you save on each order makes bi-coastal achievement a internet gain.Zone-skippingAn business term for moving inventory closer to the ultimate supply deal with is zone skipping. You may place a bunch of orders in bulk on a truck and drive throughout a number of zones. Then you definately ship your stock to a service for regional or local supply. When you use a bi-coastal 3PL supplier, you might be successfully zone skipping together with your merchandise.Free DeliveryDividing your inventory amongst a number of warehouses can even assist you to obtain the gold customary of eCommerce: free delivery. Free shipping is the best way to place a smile in your customer’s face and a click on in their fingers. Warehouses nearer to your finish consumer, make free transport pencil out. İt can save you enough on shipping prices to offer free transport on some or your whole gadgets. Bi-coastal success can increase your bottom line by rising your sales.How Many Success Warehouses are Too Many?Depending on the fulfillment company you select, you could possibly place your stock in many warehouses throughout the country. One success warehouse may be too few. However spreading your stock throughout 10 warehouses could stretch your stock and your assets too thin. If your technique is to reach as many shoppers as potential with one-day supply, the investment may be price it. However, too many areas could broaden your enterprise past its carrying capacity. That would cut into the growth of your eCommerce firm.The best achievement service supplier for you is one that matches your fulfillment strategy. Find one with achievement warehouse areas that fit together with your achievement plan.Managing Success Warehouse InventoryThe biggest challenge while you ship from more than one fulfillment middle is stock administration.

      "text": "Colleges usually require students to send in a deposit by May 1 in order to hold a spot in the incoming freshman class. But some schools are offering more flexibility to students as the coronavirus crisis grows.Over the past week, more than 200 colleges and universities have said they'll push the deadline to at least June 1, according to a tally by a nonprofit group called ACCEPT (Admissions Community Cultivating Equity & Peace Today).Video above: Where does the money go? Breaking down the costs of collegeThat includes the highly-selective Williams College in Massachusetts, Gonzaga University in Washington, and the University of Illinois at Chicago.\"There is real financial uncertainty for everyone at this moment, and May 1 seems awfully close. Having that extra four weeks to process the decision is really invaluable,\" said Marie Bigham, the founder of ACCEPT and a former college admissions director. It's not just about paying the deposit, which can typically range between $500 and $1,000. Committing to a college means taking on the burden of tuition and other costs just as the economy is facing an unprecedented calamity — adding more pressure on prospective students trying to decide between schools.Millions of Americans' jobs are at risk and the stock market has plummeted, erasing nearly all gains made since President Donald Trump was sworn in.Families' 529 college savings accounts could be looking a lot smaller than they were just a month ago. On Friday, Trump said he would allow existing student loan borrowers to suspend student loan payments amid rising layoffs.New Jersey high school senior Jillian Moran said she spent a lot of time on the phone last week trying to better understand her financial aid award from Penn State.The boutique she works at after school has closed because of the coronavirus outbreak and she's worried about not having enough spending money saved up. She's feeling even more pressure because she was planning to start classes this summer.As of Friday, the college has not moved its May 1 decision deadline but explicitly told accepted students in an email not to come visit the campus in person. Moran has been to Penn State before, but never for a formal tour and was expecting to visit next month.\"I'm pretty freaked out. Everything is closing, there's no end in sight, and they're still going to ask me on May 1 whether or not I'm coming,\" Moran said.For those students who haven't yet visited their top-choice schools, making a decision about where to enroll will become more of a challenge now that they won't be able to get any face time with current students, admissions counselors or financial aid advisers.Gracyn Devine was planning to attend an admitted students day at the University of Rhode Island next weekend — until the college canceled the event and all tours, along with suspending in-person classes because of the coronavirus pandemic.Instead, Devine, a high school senior from New Jersey, visited the university on Friday with her parents. Hardly anyone was on campus, she said, but they were able to pick up a map from a mailbox outside the closed welcome center and use it to take their own self-guided tour.\"I really liked the campus — and I think that's a good sign if I liked it even when no one was there,\" said Devine, who's still trying to decide between the University of Rhode Island and the University of Delaware, which she's visited before.

Breaking down the costs of college\nThat includes the highly-selective Williams College in Massachusetts, Gonzaga University in Washington, and the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\"There is real financial uncertainty for everyone at this moment, and May 1 seems awfully close. Having that extra four weeks to process the decision is really invaluable,\" said Marie Bigham, the founder of ACCEPT and a former college admissions director.\nIt's not just about paying the deposit, which can typically range between $500 and $1,000.\nCommitting to a college means taking on the burden of tuition and other costs just as the economy is facing an unprecedented calamity — adding more pressure on prospective students trying to decide between schools.\nMillions of Americans' jobs are at risk and the stock market has plummeted, erasing nearly all gains made since President Donald Trump was sworn in.\nFamilies' 529 college savings accounts could be looking a lot smaller than they were just a month ago. On Friday, Trump said he would allow existing student loan borrowers to suspend student loan payments amid rising layoffs. 'It still breaks your heart': Rites of passage are deferred as students adjust to school in isolation\nNew Jersey high school senior Jillian Moran said she spent a lot of time on the phone last week trying to better understand her financial aid award from Penn State.\nThe boutique she works at after school has closed because of the coronavirus outbreak and she's worried about not having enough spending money saved up. She's feeling even more pressure because she was planning to start classes this summer.\nAs of Friday, the college has not moved its May 1 decision deadline but explicitly told accepted students in an email not to come visit the campus in person. Moran has been to Penn State before, but never for a formal tour and was expecting to visit next month.\n\"I'm pretty freaked out. Everything is closing, there's no end in sight, and they're still going to ask me on May 1 whether or not I'm coming,\" Moran said.\nFor those students who haven't yet visited their top-choice schools, making a decision about where to enroll will become more of a challenge now that they won't be able to get any face time with current students, admissions counselors or financial aid advisers.\nGracyn Devine was planning to attend an admitted students day at the University of Rhode Island next weekend — until the college canceled the event and all tours, along with suspending in-person classes because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nInstead, Devine, a high school senior from New Jersey, visited the university on Friday with her parents. Hardly anyone was on campus, she said, but they were able to pick up a map from a mailbox outside the closed welcome center and use it to take their own self-guided tour.\n\"I really liked the campus — and I think that's a good sign if I liked it even when no one was there,\" said Devine, who's still trying to decide between the University of Rhode Island and the University of Delaware, which she's visited before.",

      "text": "Ugh. Covid 19 and it’s associated market uncertainties have resulted in a suspension of our search to buy property at this time. Granted rates are low but so is inventory and the stock market. My poor 401k has taken a beating. Nevertheless, I am grateful to so far only have these relatively minor financial impacts. SO and I are both still able to work as normal and I know that’s a blessing.\nI’ve given notice to my current barn. Nice time right? But since I won’t be moving him home anytime soon it seems, I need a different boarding situation. I’ve found a lovely facility quite close to home that offers a lovely array of amenities and services. My only concern is the turn out. The turn outs are impeccably fenced and maintained with an abundance of space and excellent grass. However the BO will not consider over night turn out. Horses are turned out all day every day bar thunderstorms or excessive heat. We live in FL so excessive heat is every day in the summer. During the summer horses go out half a day in the morning. BO is willing to accommodate my desire for extra turn out by also turning my boy out after pm feed around 5/6 until night check around 930. The stalls are traditional boxes, no attached paddock/run. Stalls are matted and bedded to a depth of @ 4”. I am unsure if it is concrete or clay under mats. I’m concerned about him standing in the stall so much. His physical and mental health are of course very important to me. I know that a lot of horses get less turn out. What say you COTHers? Is this adequate turnout? There is another farm a little further away that offers a more customizable turn out schedule up to 24/7 outside. But it is much busier and other aspects of care, while solid are not as customizable as my first choice.\nFirst choice barn also offers blanketing, boots, fly spray, fly mask on and off daily to my specifications included in cost. Also offers ability to supply my own feed of choice for an appropriate discount on board cost. BO states that her philosophy is horses should always have something to chew and feeds 4-5 flakes of hay in stalls on average and is willing to use my porta grazer in stall. I believe this enough hay for him to always have it in front of him. All stalls have exterior windows and half doors to center aisle that horses can put head through. So he would be able to look out front and back of stall. Two high velocity fans and three 5 gal water buckets in stalls. Would your horse be comfortable standing in this stall 15-18 hours a day? Am I being overly worried? I’m stressing out here!",

We all know times will be tough, but i don't mind putting in extras if it gets us out of this hole in the short term, just don't destroy my wealth! Expand Over the past year our AUD has lost 21.5% vs the USD.\nhttps://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=AUD&to=USD&view=1Y\nWith the drought, the fires & now the Covid-19 we can expect a dramatic\nreset of the stock market to reflect our impending recession. The lift over the\npast few days is simply a dead cat bounce, IMO.\nI walked along a cafe/resturant strip this evening of about 50-60 businesses and they were virtually empty.\nOne owner told me that he had already retrenched three quarters of his staff and he was relying on takeaways\nnow to pay the rent.\nThe residential hotels a few blocks away were in a similar position to the resturants and cafes ( virtually empty ) offering rooms at 60% discount!\nThe supermarkets seem to be the only ones benefiting at present.\nThe PM's announcement this PM virtually shut down pubs, clubs, resturants Cafes gyms and your normal discretionary\nspend businesses. This will mean bankrupcy for many , devalue real estate and stun the economy.\nThe question is who will pay.? At present we have not had offers from the billionaires who have trippled their wealth since the GFC,\nthanks to generous tax laws and we have had multinationals doubling their revenue in that period also and again treated very leintly\nby the ATO:\nhttps://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=AUD&to=USD&view=1Y\nIts now time that the Government made these multinationals pony-up and pay their fair share of tax at a time when the country is in strife.\nSomeone will have to pay for the $180 Billion handout package announced yesterday and unless action is taken now, it will be the unfortunate PAYE\nworkers who will have to pay later. This is what happened in Ireland and other European countries post the GFC which did not hit us thanks to China bailing us out with its additional demand for our exports and the accompanying high export prices.\n(Pssst...we're not sending our war ships up through the China Sea now)\nThis time will be different, IMO, because China has been gutted already by the virus and the US Tariffs and besides China will want to support its neighbours such as Mongolia, Russis etc.\nDue to our obvious pro Trump stance on China, the Chinese will be very selective this time around when it comes to the supply of raw materials to\nsupport its own economic recovery, IMO.\nIMO doubling royalties on our Iron Ore & Coal should yield about $8 billion P/A extra State Government income which would just about pay the interest only on the current Government handouts. We are already paying about $20 billion interest on the rest.\nUnlike 2008, we are already loaded with soverign, state, muni, personal & business debts. If we add he lot together we're in the hole for over $7 trillion; 4 times our GDP.\nWith massive unemployment imminent, real estate prices are bound to tumble more than 2008/2010 which will put some recent Gen Y home owners under water, IMO.\nWhen all this blows by this increased Government spending will have to be paid and who better than those who control our valueable mineral resources !\nPS: Gold at present seems to be the best preserver of wealth!",

      "text": "Originally posted by moorookamick: ↑ Over the past year our AUD has lost 21.5% vs the USD.\nhttps://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=AUD&to=USD&view=1Y\nWith the drought, the fires & now the Covid-19 we can expect a dramatic\nreset of the stock market to reflect our impending recession. The lift over the\npast few days is simply a dead cat bounce, IMO.\nI walked along a cafe/resturant strip this evening of about 50-60 businesses and they were virtually empty.\nOne owner told me that he had already retrenched three quarters of his staff and he was relying on takeaways\nnow to pay the rent.\nThe residential hotels a few blocks away were in a similar position to the resturants and cafes ( virtually empty ) offering rooms at 60% discount!\nThe supermarkets seem to be the only ones benefiting at present.\nThe PM's announcement this PM virtually shut down pubs, clubs, resturants Cafes gyms and your normal discretionary\nspend businesses. This will mean bankrupcy for many , devalue real estate and stun the economy.\nThe question is who will pay.? At present we have not had offers from the billionaires who have trippled their wealth since the GFC,\nthanks to generous tax laws and we have had multinationals doubling their revenue in that period also and again treated very leintly\nby the ATO:\nhttps://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=AUD&to=USD&view=1Y\nIts now time that the Government made these multinationals pony-up and pay their fair share of tax at a time when the country is in strife.\nSomeone will have to pay for the $180 Billion handout package announced yesterday and unless action is taken now, it will be the unfortunate PAYE\nworkers who will have to pay later. This is what happened in Ireland and other European countries post the GFC which did not hit us thanks to China bailing us out with its additional demand for our exports and the accompanying high export prices.\n(Pssst...we're not sending our war ships up through the China Sea now)\nThis time will be different, IMO, because China has been gutted already by the virus and the US Tariffs and besides China will want to support its neighbours such as Mongolia, Russis etc.\nDue to our obvious pro Trump stance on China, the Chinese will be very selective this time around when it comes to the supply of raw materials to\nsupport its own economic recovery, IMO.\nIMO doubling royalties on our Iron Ore & Coal should yield about $8 billion P/A extra State Government income which would just about pay the interest only on the current Government handouts. We are already paying about $20 billion interest on the rest.\nUnlike 2008, we are already loaded with soverign, state, muni, personal & business debts. If we add he lot together we're in the hole for over $7 trillion; 4 times our GDP.\nWith massive unemployment imminent, real estate prices are bound to tumble more than 2008/2010 which will put some recent Gen Y home owners under water, IMO.\nWhen all this blows by this increased Government spending will have to be paid and who better than those who control our valueable mineral resources !\nPS: Gold at present seems to be the best preserver of wealth! Expand Yes it's gloomy\nextent\nno one knows.\nPeople have to live in buildings\neat, crap, use water elec and gas\nThe government has panicked\nmaybe they know something.\nThe plug has been pulled from the\npower point.\njobs, income, security gone.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON -- The latest: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he expects Congress and the White House to reach full agreement later Sunday on an economic stimulus package that could approach $2 trillion to address the coronavirus crisis.\nThe package would include $3,000 checks to families and other aid to last the next 10 weeks.\nMnuchin tells \"Fox News Sunday\" that there is a \"fundamental understanding\" reached with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders to provide significant aid.\nHe says the deal includes federal loans to small businesses so they can retain their workers; cash payments averaging $3,000 for a family of four as well as \"enhanced\" unemployment insurance.\nThis is a breaking news update. A previous version of this report is below.\nTop-level negotiations between Congress and the White House are pushing toward resolution on a ballooning $1 trillion-plus economic rescue package, as President Donald Trump urged a deal to steady a nation shuttered by the coronavirus pandemic.\nWith a population on edge and financial markets teetering, all sides indicated late Saturday that a deal is within reach. At issue is how best to keep paychecks flowing for millions of workers abruptly sidelined by the crisis.\nTalks also narrowed on a so-called Marshall Plan for hospitals as well as industry loans to airlines and others all but grounded by the virus outbreak and national shutdown. The post-World War II Marshall Plan helped to rebuild Western Europe.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced late Saturday all sides were \"very close\" to a bipartisan resolution.\nRELATED: Got a call about claiming your COVID-19 stimulus check? It's a scam\nMcConnell instructed committee chairmen to assemble draft legislation. Officials put the price tag at nearly $1.4 trillion and said that with other measures from the Federal Reserve it could pump $2 trillion into the U.S. economy.\n\"We are poised to deliver the significant relief that Americans need with the speed that this crisis demands,\" McConnell said.\nTalks will resume Sunday morning when the top four congressional leaders of both parties are set to confer privately at the Capitol with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in hopes of striking a final accord.\nA spokesman for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said there is \"not yet an agreement.\" Spokesman Justin Goodman said Democrats look forward to reading the draft and further negotiations.\n\"Everybody's working hard and they want to get to a solution that's the right solution, I think we're very close,\" Trump said at Saturday's briefing, striking a confident tone about the nation's ability to defeat the pandemic soon.\nOn Capitol Hill, the Senate convened the rare weekend session as negotiators raced to complete the package. The Senate's goal is to hold an initial vote Sunday and win Senate passage on Monday.\nThe urgency to act is mounting, as jobless claims skyrocket, businesses shutter and the financial markets are set to re-open Monday eager for signs that Washington can soften the blow of the healthcare crisis and what experts say is a looming recession.\nTrump has largely stayed out of the details, but said Saturday that he would be lobbying the lead negotiators.\nOn one topic, Trump appears to be agreeing with Democrats as Washington tries to steer clear of the politically toxic bailouts from the last economic crises.\nTrump expressed a clear distaste for any industry, including the airlines, that would use federal assistance to buy back its own stock in an effort to increase profits. Banning stock buy-backs is one of Democrats' top business priorities in the emerging package.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other top White House officials were on Capitol Hill for a second day of nonstop negotiations. But no announcement was expected.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been in talks with Mnuchin, returned to Washington on Saturday and was scheduled to join Sunday's meeting.\nNegotiations are focused on providing direct relief to Americans, with one-time checks of $1,200, as well as ongoing payroll support and enhanced unemployment benefits for the newly out of work.\nTalks are also focused on loans to airlines and other industries blindsided by the crisis, as well as possible aid to the states and billions for hospitals and healthcare providers on the front lines of the outbreak.\nThe emerging package builds on a GOP proposal but Democrats push for add-ons, including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers.\n\"We're making very good progress,\" Schumer said late Saturday. \"We're going to continue working though the night.\"\nRELATED: How is coronavirus spread? Symptoms, prevention, and how to prepare for a COVID-19 outbreak\nOn Saturday, Trump opened the daily virus briefing with a roll call of his administration's accomplishments, a week-in-review meant to rebut criticism that the White House was moving too slowly to combat the crisis.\nThe president pushed back against accusations that he was sluggish to act for fear of upsetting China, though he told aides last month that he had not wanted to alienate Beijing by criticizing its secretive handling of the initial outbreak.\nTrump did not lose his temper, as he did the day before. But mixed, vague messaging still ruled the briefing.\nFor example, as hospitals across the nation report a dire shortage of supplies to care for an expected surge of patients, Vice President Mike Pence said the government was completing a half-billion-dollar order for masks. But none of the government officials at the briefing could suggest when the masks would reach medical facilities, a moment of confusion that caused Trump to grow visibly frustrated.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, tried not to over-promise the effectiveness or speed of medication that could possibly be used to treat the virus. After Trump had exited the briefing room, Fauci answered a question about a Trump tweet about the drugs by saying, \"I'm not totally sure what the president was referring to.\"\nTrump also sowed confusion about his use of the Defense Production Act to force American businesses to manufacture needed medical supplies, saying that while he invoked the act this week, he has not yet needed to utilize it to compel businesses to mobilize, despite the pronounced supply shortage.\nPence announced that, out of an abundance of caution, he and his wife, Karen, would be tested for the virus after a member of the vice president's staff had tested positive. The result for both was negative, Pence press secretary Katie Miller tweeted Saturday night.\nPence had said the staffer, who did not have close contact with either the president or vice president, was doing well.\nThe emerging rescue plan from Congress would be a striking intervention at enormous cost being crafted with a speed unseen since the 2008-09 financial crisis and recession.\nIt builds on Trump's request for Congress to \"go big.\"\nRELATED: Cancellations, suspensions and shortages related to the global coronavirus outbreak\nA central element is now $350 billion for small businesses to keep making payroll. Companies with 500 or fewer employees could tap up to $10 million in forgivable small business loans to keep paychecks flowing.\nThat's on top of a proposal for one-time checks to all Americans, $1,200 per individual, $2,400 for couples, cut off at higher incomes.\nDemocrats are pushing for increased eligibility for unemployment insurance for those who jobs are simply disappearing.\nFor industry, the initial GOP plan called for $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries, which would have to be repaid.\nNegotiators are still hammering out whether there will be money to the states, whose governors have requested billions, as well as how much will be going to hospitals and healthcare providers.\nTrump acknowledged the outbreak was hurting his family's business of hotels and country clubs but said he did not know whether his business would be one of the many to seek government assistance.\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\nThe vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. ",

      "text": "FDA is streamlining labs to allow independent coronavirus testing after CDC showed they were just as cumbersome and incompetent as I'd worried for years, they're cutting red tape for hand sanitizer \"approval\" , getting treatments to market without 90-day comment periods where activists can insist science is a vast corporate conspiracy.What's going on? Coronavirus , that's what.The one way to show how useless most regulations are is to have a public health crisis you hope would never happen. Last month CDC literally told UC Davis they couldn't have a test to see if a patient had COVID-19 unless they first proved the patient had COVID-19 . When they finally sent tests to states, they were contaminated. How did we ever get convinced that centralized bureaucracy was the best solution to anything? That 1,000 patients in a clinical trial was not enough but 2,000 would be fine? That a change in the color of a label on a drug should require 18 months of regulatory effort? Or that a manufacturing problem in an epinephrine product should mean that the company would have to undergo registration all over again? Why not just create a standard and anyone who meets it can make it, and if they don't they get fines? Flickr, creative commons. Those blockages that prevent innovation now were not determined by public health needs, they were all politics that resulted from political theater. The same politics that led to New York spending $575,000,000 to subsidize a solar panel plant while telling scientists and doctors to create a rationing plan for the coronavirus pandemics the state had narrowly missed in 2003 and 2012 and with H1N1 in 2009. A solar panel plant in a state where it snows five months per year. Instead of buying the 16,000 ventilators experts said the state needed. Now Senator Chuck Schumer tells companies they should have been prepared for this \"rainy day\" - obviously coronavirus can be dismissed as a rainy day only when you're a wealthy politician with the world's best health care and income whether you work or not. Meanwhile, he said nothing when New York was not preparing for the disease outbreak literally everyone knew would come in. In early 2018 a team of us published The Next Plague And How Science Will Stop It (that link is to a free download of the galley, you can buy it on Amazon in print form) because we knew it was coming, it was just as matter of it would be a virus like this or an intentional act.We the public got convinced government was ready for this because things were good. When things get bad, we learn better. People get a lot more skeptical. If you want to find plenty of toilet paper, milk, and eggs today, go to Whole Foods. The minute this coronavirus crisis became real people flocked to normal food and goods. Even in my town, which got a Whole Foods when the store only put them in wealthy liberal neighborhoods, shelves are stocked. Two months ago Non-GMO Project touted how their 67,000 stickers on products led to a healthier world but now they sound absolutely tone-deaf as they continue to market fake hysteria about modern science and health in the presence of a real threat.Those of us inside science policy knew we were unprepared for anything important because we saw partisan bureaucratic creep grind the wheels of discovery and prevention to a halt. Efforts to get government science back to something close to the middle, with efforts to stop \"secret sauce\" in government panel decisions, conflicts of interest inside EPA, or streamlining drug approval so it wasn't just Big Pharma able to afford to bring products to market, We were told the people behind reform ideas hated the public and lives would be lost due to invisible pollution or a dearth of new papers linking some harmless food to some new disease.It was all nonsense, and now the public sees it. So maybe now scientists inside government the political mandate to fix itself.FDA is loosening the stranglehold on hand sanitizer approval because people are making it themselves. That shows you how little government regulatory hammers decided by politicians are needed. A bureaucracy that allows $30 billion in supplement claims and $100 billion in organic food claims that it is \"healthier\" has kept the public from having clean hands .Regulatory reform motivation that may come of this won't last forever, bureaucratic creep is a fungus that only stops growing until times are good again, but the pro-science public should stop complaining about the other political party and demand real reform of the institution itself.More about SARS-CoV-2, the 2019 form of coronavirus, and the COVID-19 disease it causes:",

But some schools are offering more flexibility to students as the coronavirus crisis grows.Over the past week, more than 200 colleges and universities have said they'll push the deadline to at least June 1, according to a tally by a nonprofit group called ACCEPT (Admissions Community Cultivating Equity & Peace Today).Video above: Where does the money go? Breaking down the costs of collegeThat includes the highly-selective Williams College in Massachusetts, Gonzaga University in Washington, and the University of Illinois at Chicago.\"There is real financial uncertainty for everyone at this moment, and May 1 seems awfully close. Having that extra four weeks to process the decision is really invaluable,\" said Marie Bigham, the founder of ACCEPT and a former college admissions director. It's not just about paying the deposit, which can typically range between $500 and $1,000. Committing to a college means taking on the burden of tuition and other costs just as the economy is facing an unprecedented calamity — adding more pressure on prospective students trying to decide between schools.Millions of Americans' jobs are at risk and the stock market has plummeted, erasing nearly all gains made since President Donald Trump was sworn in.Families' 529 college savings accounts could be looking a lot smaller than they were just a month ago. On Friday, Trump said he would allow existing student loan borrowers to suspend student loan payments amid rising layoffs.New Jersey high school senior Jillian Moran said she spent a lot of time on the phone last week trying to better understand her financial aid award from Penn State.The boutique she works at after school has closed because of the coronavirus outbreak and she's worried about not having enough spending money saved up. She's feeling even more pressure because she was planning to start classes this summer.As of Friday, the college has not moved its May 1 decision deadline but explicitly told accepted students in an email not to come visit the campus in person. Moran has been to Penn State before, but never for a formal tour and was expecting to visit next month.\"I'm pretty freaked out. Everything is closing, there's no end in sight, and they're still going to ask me on May 1 whether or not I'm coming,\" Moran said.For those students who haven't yet visited their top-choice schools, making a decision about where to enroll will become more of a challenge now that they won't be able to get any face time with current students, admissions counselors or financial aid advisers.Gracyn Devine was planning to attend an admitted students day at the University of Rhode Island next weekend — until the college canceled the event and all tours, along with suspending in-person classes because of the coronavirus pandemic.Instead, Devine, a high school senior from New Jersey, visited the university on Friday with her parents. Hardly anyone was on campus, she said, but they were able to pick up a map from a mailbox outside the closed welcome center and use it to take their own self-guided tour.\"I really liked the campus — and I think that's a good sign if I liked it even when no one was there,\" said Devine, who's still trying to decide between the University of Rhode Island and the University of Delaware, which she's visited before.

      "title": "Sen. Burr defends stock sales as fellow Republicans call for invest..",
      "text": "Republican Sen. Richard Burr is defending his decision to sell up to $1.72 million in stock ahead of the impact of coronavirus on global markets and has called on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate whether he breached any laws or congressional rules.\n\"I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks on Feb. 13,\" Burr, of North Carolina, said of the controversial trades. \"Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight, however, I spoke this morning with the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency.\"\nBurr, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued his statement as he and several other senators are facing intense scrutiny over the fortuitous timing of stock trades they made -- as members of Congress were being briefed on the potential severity of the coming crisis, but before many in the general public were fully aware of the havoc the virus could wreak on the U.S. economy. Reports of these trades have brought criticism from all quarters.\nSources within the president's inner circle said they were frustrated by trading activity, saying if Burr used information obtained in closed-door briefings he should resign. But during his public remarks Friday, President Trump dismissed the accusations, saying he found all the senators identified as \"very honorable.\"\nTrump noted that one of those making trades was a Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, of California. Between late January and mid-February, she sold off up to $6 million worth stock -- but the trades did not appear to be connected with companies impacted by the pandemic. She said she had \"no input\" on her husband's financial transactions.\nOklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe reported the sale of up to half-a-million-dollars worth of stock in major industries between late January and mid-February, but said Friday he had not attended the Jan. 24 briefing on the virus, which was the first closed-door, all-Senate briefing on the matter, and had not communicated with his broker about the trades. Feinstein was also not at that first briefing.\nTrades by Burr and Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) raised heightened attention, experts said, because there appeared to be direct ties between the trades and the coming medical crisis. Among the shares Burr sold were holdings in the hospitality industry, including up to $350,000 worth of stock in Extended Stay America, Wydham, and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc.-- a spin-off of Hilton. While Loeffler sold large quantities of stock, one of only two purchases the Georgia senator made was a $250,000 investment in Citrix Systems, which creates remote work software.\nLoeffler, a Republican from Georgia, went on Fox News on Friday to defend her high volume of trades that began the day in late January when the Senate health committee she is on was briefed on the evolving threat of coronavirus.\n\"I do want to set the record straight. I have seen some of those stories and it's absolutely false and it could not be true,\" she said. \"If you actually look at the personal transaction reports that were filed it notices at the bottom that I am only informed of my transactions after they occur -- several weeks.\"\nBurr's Feb. 13 trades have brought the most scrutiny because they came seemingly out of the blue -- he had not reported trades for more than a year -- and they involved sales of his holdings in the hospitality industry. Filings he made with the Senate show he sold a hefty portion of his portfolio just a week after he wrote an op-ed on the Fox News website saying \"the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus.\"\nEven some Republicans Friday were urging the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch an investigation into Burr's trades to determine if they violated the STOCK Act, a law that prohibits members of Congress or their staffers from profiting from their access to secret or non-public information. The law -- which Burr voted against when it passed in 2012 on a 98-2 vote -- carries both civil and criminal penalties.\nA spokesperson for the SEC declined to say whether the agency would look into the trades.\nMatthew Sanderson, a Republican, is an ethics lawyer with the Washington, D.C., firm Caplin & Drysdale. He told ABC News he views Burr's statement as a \"last gasp type of defense.\" He said several aspects of Burr's stock sale raise red flags. First, Burr acknowledges that he directed the trades himself. Burr says he decided to sell his stocks based on CNBC's health and science reporting out of Asia. At the time, CNBC was carrying reports on the potential for coronavirus to reach the U.S., and on the signs that travel demand would slump across the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"You have the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman saying, as a last resort defense, that he wasn't relying on his classified briefings, but was instead simply referencing CNBC reports that were available to the entire market,\" Sanderson said. \"To me that doesn't hold any water.\"\"\nIf the CNBC reports drove his decision, Sanderson said, you would expect to see others making similar sales. Markets are designed to respond to publicly available knowledge, he said, and yet Burr's sales came weeks ahead of those by the broader public.\n\"These are exactly the type of facts that gave rise to the STOCK Act,\" Sanderson said. \"That's why I think it should be investigated. You shouldn't be telling the public one thing, and your broker another.\"\nIn addition to the SEC, the Senate Ethics Committee has purview over the conduct of sitting members. Burr's Republican colleague from North Carolina, Sen. Thom Tillis, said on Twitter Friday that he believes the ethics committee should get involved.\n\"Given the circumstances, Senator Burr owes North Carolinians an explanation,\" Tillis wrote. \"His self-referral to the Ethics Committee for their review is appropriate, there needs to be a professional and bipartisan inquiry into this matter, which the Ethics Committee can provide.\" Report a correction or typo Related topics:",

      "text": "March 22, 2020 | Leave a comment | Home Considerations To Know About third party shipping Drop shipping is a process of product fulfillment that occurs straight from the producer or dealer to the client when the order is placed on a third-party store's site or over the phone, preventing the traditional retail supply chain.The method of decline delivery was first introduced around 1928 however shed energy due to the Great Anxiety. Toyota after that applied a Just-In-Time (JIT) supply chain in the 1950s. The benefits of JIT inventory administration quickly came to be apparent. The contemporary drop ship organisation version mirrors the major styles of the JIT supply chain by eliminating pricey inventory transport and also storage space expenses for stores.How Decrease Shipping WorksWhen an order is positioned through your internet site, it is immediately transmitted to your manufacturer, supplier, or dealer to be loaded as well as delivered, eliminating one of the most expensive element of the standard physical service model.Although you might anticipate the drop carrier to be the supplier of the product in question, there exists a market for wholesalers to go down ship items and also even use personalization. For example, let's state you start a clothing brand offering tees. You might go the traditional course, purchasing hundreds of t-shirts with your designs screen published, running the risk that your product does not offer well or in all. Or, you can explore dealing with a decrease ship partner that uses custom-made printing services. In this scenario, your client orders your new tee shirt which is directed to your decline carrier to publish as well as satisfy. Keep in mind that this may or may not be the actual supplier of the item or tee shirt in this instance.Why the Decrease Ship Company Model?Reduced financing demandsIf you pursue the drop ship organisation design, you will certainly be happily surprised by the financial forecasts. When you begin a firm that satisfies orders via drop delivery, you will not normally research and also create a brand-new product, manufacture the item, or accumulation stock; which limits the capital requirements to expenditures mainly relating to legal company development as well as the modern technologies called for to run your company.Low-risk validationDecline delivery distinctively uses the advantage of evaluating the waters prior to diving in. If you doubt whether your t shirt layout will market, or any product for that matter, it's ideal not to sink all your sources into it. Although decrease shipping can be much more expensive on an each basis, in general the financial threat is restricted. Decrease shipping is also a great method to check the quality of a brand-new distributor because you will certainly not be compelled to acquire hundreds and even hundreds of units that might be defective.Take care of from anywhereIf you negotiate with a supplier Additional hints that additionally manages returns, your just physical tie to the business is a computer. If you will be dealing with returns, it might be necessary to rent out a storage space device, office space, or even co-working space to deal with these returns.Personal label decline deliverySome decrease shipping suppliers even allow you, the merchant, to project the status of a recognized brand name. This is achieved through custom printing and on-demand manufacturing. When your client orders, the vendor will begin the assembly line and also produce your product on demand. If you wish to go down ship private label products, or items identified and packaged with your company's branding, you will certainly require to partner with an on-demand provider.Exist Drawbacks to Go Down Delivery?Very affordableAccording to Google Trends, awareness around the decline delivery model doubled in 2016 after years of stagnancy. Although the usage of products has actually not reduced, the market has changed from physical to eCommerce. This brand-new world of virtual retail has actually permitted the decentralization of market share. Customers are now spreading their budgets over many vendors instead of purchasing at just a couple of retailers.Lack of distinct marketing proposition (USP).Although drop delivery can allow for minor product modification, the extent of this personalization is extremely minimal. Unless you are driving adequate revenue for the provider, your product will certainly be functionally the same to the vendor's lots of other drop ship clients. If your product can not stick out as unique when compared to the competitive landscape, you will likely be required to contend for the lowest cost.Not enough quality assurance.All suppliers experience a percentage of malfunctioning finished items, even if less than one percent. In the past, makers would examine for high quality with the understanding that the store will likewise look at when unboxing. When merchants forfeit this straight oversight of quality assurance, manufacturers may unwind their criteria resulting in more faulty products. This can intimidate your organisation as returns will probably boost.Slim margins.Since mass production leverages economic situations of scale, distributors supply price cuts for high amount orders. The economic exchange for low-scale production when drop shipping is a higher system cost, consequently lowering your margin.Unavailable.Handing over the inventory administration obligations to a provider can additionally mean blind faith on the oversight as well as communication of supply degrees you may have offered up for sale on your website. If a customer orders a product that is out of supply, it can be an aggravating experience for all events. It is best to talk about stock monitoring throughout partnership settlements and have a treatment in position for refunds or substitute. Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

      "text": "Malaysia should provide financial aid to all malaysians that are affect by RMO .A lot of sector have been harm by RMO for example retail , oil sector , tourism, hawker , air transportation and entertainment . Malaysia government should be responsible to help all business and ordinary Malaysian to face the challenge. It is government responsibility to protect our benefits .\nOther countries have more progressive stimulus plan like USA\nGERMANY, CANADA and few more countries, RM600 simply not enough imagine how a family of 4 or 5 can rely on just RM600 for 2 weeks . Please be remember that at least 70 percent and more donot have enought saving to encounter such RMO losses . Those person in Malay phrase “kais pagi makan pagi , kais petang makan petang”. Malaysia should hold responsibility to protect Malaysian from the disaster called coronavirus COVID-19.\nMalaysia is well known as a welfare state , so I really conffident and believe government have the ability to give a hand to those who need the government help nor matter it is individual , organisation , or business.\nMalaysia government can implement following action to help our beloves Malaysian\n1. Provide atleast RM 1200 to all Malaysian who losses their job such as tourist guide , bus driver, shop retailer , hawker ,oil industry and entertainment.\n2. Provide low interest loan to all business .\n3. Lower the income tax of M40 and B40.\n4. Lower the company tax.\n5.Give higher special elaun to frontliner RM500 per person because they risk themselves to fight the desease. Some doctor and nurse work 14 hours a day to cope with patient.\n6. Provide at least 20 billion economic stimulus plan because our stock market is down drastically and our currency values also down.\n7. Allow EPF contributer to take out some of the money to pay their bill.\n8. Lower the electricity bill and water bill by atleast 20 percent. (international fuel prices decrease drastically since last year)\n9.Provide free consultant to all workers and business that face difficulty.\n10. If really cannot provide free tertiary education for our sons, government should atleast reduce the tuition fee for all Malaysian in IPTA and IPTS.\nGovernment should reduce our burden not to increase it. I know Malaysian will have a hard time to go through because Brent crude oil is now under 30 dollar a tong government revenue will reduce atleast 20 billions Ringgit Malaysia if I am not mistaken. Tourism industry also damage by COVID-19 . Ringgit Malaysia plunged to its lowest level since 2017 as US Dollar indicator rise to its highest level level since 2008 financial crisis. Next financial crisis will come soon , Malaysia government please be prepared to protect Malaysian from the chaos. Thanks.",

      "title": "PhosAgro CEO Andrey Guryev Takes Part in First Meeting of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Coordination Council to Combat Coronavirus",
      "text": "MOSCOW , March 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- PhosAgro CEO Andrey Guryev , who is a member of the Bureau of the Management Board of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RUIE), took part in the first meeting of the RUIE Coordination Council on combating coronavirus (the \"Council\").\nThe Council includes members of the RUIE Bureau and the Bureau of the RUIE Management Board, as well as the heads of Gazprom Neft, Alrosa, Rosmedprom, Sibur, Russian Railways, TMK and others. At the meeting, members discussed a plan for both top-priority and long-term measures to counter the spread of COVID-19.\nThe President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and the Chairman of the Council, Aleksandr Shokhin , stressed that the RUIE would work closely with the Coordinating Council in the Fight against Coronavirus, headed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin , and with the Working Group of the State Council for Combating Coronavirus, led by Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin .\n\"Our short-term goal is to stop the spread of coronavirus and to introduce a testing system; our long-term goal is to create a vaccine and develop effective methods to treat infection. Under any scenario, the business community must play a role in preventing the spread of the virus,\" said Mr Shokhin, noting that it would be necessary to use innovative medical and pharmaceutical technologies and draw on the experience of both domestic and foreign companies and organisations in order to achieve these goals.\nCommenting on the results of the Council meeting, its co-chair on behalf of major industries, PhosAgro CEO Andrey Guryev , who is also a member of the Bureau of the RUIE Management Board and President of the Russian Fertilizer Producers Association, noted the importance of creating an RUIE Coordinating Council involving major strategically important companies, whose actions will have an impact on the social and economic stability of various regions of Russia and the country as a whole.\n\"Our shared priority in this challenging epidemiological situation is to protect the health of workers and to ensure the stable operation of companies, as well as transport and energy infrastructure.\n\"A key factor in the sustainable operation of any business is the preservation of all links in established supply chains. To achieve this goal, it is important to exchange best practices within the Council in terms of disease prevention, remote working and the epidemiological safety of employees in the workplace.\n\"Special attention should be paid to ensuring the energy security of production facilities and, first and foremost, of all medical and healthcare facilities. The public and employees need to be informed in full and as quickly as possible about the preventive measures being taken in order to coordinate efforts both among members of the RUIE and with the authorities.\n\"It is important that leading Russian companies that are members of global associations cooperate in maintaining global supply chains and exchange best practices in terms of prevention through international platforms such as the World Economic Forum. UN platforms, in particular the WHO, are being widely used. Members of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs have access to international expertise and response protocols in the face of epidemics, primarily the successful experience of China , South Korea , Singapore , and Hong Kong , which will enable us to use best practices in terms of epidemic response measures in Russia .\n\"Cooperation with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) as a whole is one of the key areas of the Council's work. The first outcome of this cooperation will be the rapid launch of pilot coronavirus testing for all employees of RUIE member companies, testing that was developed with the support of the RDIF. The next stage will be to test as much of the population as possible, which, as international experience has shown, is a key factor in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\"At the same time, we intend to go further and, as part of our efforts to fight the pandemic, to develop, under the auspices of the RUIE, new forms of long-term interaction between the RDIF and big business, first of all in terms of support from big business and the RDIF for fundamental and applied medical and health research.\n\"In overcoming this crisis, we must develop tools that will protect society against a recurrence. We need to create a system that can quickly develop safe and effective vaccines and antiviral drugs, get their approval and produce millions of doses within a few months after a pathogen is discovered. A major issue is the streamlining of regulatory policy, which will allow us to quickly adapt foreign experience and facilitate the import of drugs and medical technologies.\n\"This is a difficult challenge; overcoming it will require close cooperation between big business and the state. And we are prepared for this cooperation,\" stressed Mr Guryev.\nAbout the Company\nPhosAgro ( www.phosagro.com ) is one of the world's leading vertically integrated phosphate-based fertilizer producers in terms of production volumes of phosphate-based fertilizers and high-grade phosphate rock with a P2O5 content of 39% and higher.

      "text": "Ohio is still holding at 247 known cases of the virus, but of course the day is still young…\nHowever, that said, I gotta drive into town and go to the market. My first time actually in and among a group of total strangers in 8 days. So I’m gonna go early and hopefully beat the crowd of Sunday shoppers. (Still no known cases in Muskingum County, though.)\nIt’s a gorgeous day out there today, but still really cold. But it will be a pretty drive into town.\nConfirmed cases are up all over the world: approximately 206,000 now. However, almost 95% of those cases are considered mild: 196,442. And we’re up to about 96,000 recoveries as of right now (3/22/2020).\nAnd now there is that horrible earthquake thrown into the mix in Zagreb. It does indeed keep seeming Biblical out there, doesn’t it, gang?\nHere, in Crazeysburg, everything is still normal. The Evangelical Community Bible church here, which is right across the road from the dollar store, has a sign out front now that says: Stock Up On Jesus.\nI feel pretty confident that doing that can only help.\nWell, today I’m going to continue working on the outline for In the Shadow of Narcissa, since now my main goal is to get that chapbook finished and off my desk by late Spring.\nI will likely post again later this evening. Perhaps something amazing will happen at the market in town that you’ll all want to know about!\nFor now, I’m leaving you with this! A gem from my wee bonny although very-much-disturbed teenhood. I always took the message of this song to heart and I still do! I’m so serious. (If you weren’t aware of it, Kenny Rogers passed away yesterday at the age of 81.) Thanks for visiting, gang. I’ll be back. I love you guys. See ya!\n“The Gambler”\nOn a warm summer’s evening On a train bound for nowhere I met up with a gambler We were both too tired to sleep So we took turns a-starin’ Out the window at the darkness The boredom overtook us And he began to speak\nHe said, “Son, I’ve made a life Out of readin’ people’s faces And knowin’ what the cards were By the way they held their eyes. So if you don’t mind my sayin’ I can see you’re out of aces For a taste of your whiskey I’ll give you some advice.”\nSo I handed him my bottle And he drank down my last swallow Then he bummed a cigarette And asked me for a light And the night got deathly quiet And his face lost all expression Said, “If you’re gonna play the game, boy, You gotta learn to play it right.\n“You got to know when to hold ’em, Know when to fold ’em, Know when to walk away, And know when to run. You never count your money When you’re sittin’ at the table. There’ll be time enough for countin’ When the dealing’s done.\n“Every gambler knows That the secret to survivin’ Is knowin’ what to throw away And knowin’ what to keep.‘Cause every hand’s a winner, And every hand’s a loser, And the best that you can hope for Is to die in your sleep.”\nAnd when he finished speakin’ He turned back toward the window Crushed out his cigarette And faded off to sleep And somewhere in the darkness The gambler he broke even And in his final words I found an ace that I could keep\nYou got to know when to hold ’em Know when to fold ’em Know when to walk away And know when to run You never count your money When you’re sittin’ at the table There’ll be time enough for countin’ When the dealing’s done\nYou’ve got to know when to hold ’em (When to hold ’em) Know when to fold ’em (When to fold ’em) Know when to walk away And know when to run You never count your money When you’re sittin’ at the table There’ll be time enough for countin’ When the dealing’s done\nYou got to know when to hold ’em Know when to fold ’em Know when to walk away And know when to run You never count your money When you’re sittin’ at the table There’ll be time enough for countin’ When the dealing’s done\n© 1978 Don Schlitz",

      "text": "Malaysia should provide financial aid to all malaysians that are affect by RMO .A lot of sector have been harm by RMO for example retail , oil sector , tourism, hawker , air transportation and entertainment . Malaysia government should be responsible to help all business and ordinary Malaysian to face the challenge. It is government responsibility to protect our benefits .\nOther countries have more progressive stimulus plan like USA\nGERMANY, CANADA and few more countries, RM600 simply not enough imagine how a family of 4 or 5 can rely on just RM600 for 2 weeks . Please be remember that at least 70 percent and more donot have enought saving to encounter such RMO losses . Those person in Malay phrase “kais pagi makan pagi , kais petang makan petang”. Malaysia should hold responsibility to protect Malaysian from the disaster called coronavirus COVID-19.\nMalaysia is well known as a welfare state , so I really conffident and believe government have the ability to give a hand to those who need the government help nor matter it is individual , organisation , or business.\nMalaysia government can implement following action to help our beloves Malaysian\n1. Provide atleast RM 1200 to all Malaysian who losses their job such as tourist guide , bus driver, shop retailer , hawker ,oil industry and entertainment.\n2. Provide low interest loan to all business .\n3. Lower the income tax of M40 and B40.\n4. Lower the company tax.\n5.Give higher special elaun to frontliner RM500 per person because they risk themselves to fight the desease. Some doctor and nurse work 14 hours a day to cope with patient.\n6. Provide at least 20 billion economic stimulus plan because our stock market is down drastically and our currency values also down.\n7. Allow EPF contributer to take out some of the money to pay their bill.\n8. Lower the electricity bill and water bill by atleast 20 percent. (international fuel prices decrease drastically since last year)\n9.Provide free consultant to all workers and business that face difficulty.\n10. If really cannot provide free tertiary education for our sons, government should atleast reduce the tuition fee for all Malaysian in IPTA and IPTS.\nGovernment should reduce our burden not to increase it. I know Malaysian will have a hard time to go through because Brent crude oil is now under 30 dollar a tong government revenue will reduce atleast 20 billions Ringgit Malaysia if I am not mistaken. Tourism industry also damage by COVID-19 . Ringgit Malaysia plunged to its lowest level since 2017 as US Dollar indicator rise to its highest level level since 2008 financial crisis. Next financial crisis will come soon , Malaysia government please be prepared to protect Malaysian from the chaos. Thanks.",

      "title": "Socialism at Its Finest after Fed’s Bazooka Fails",
      "text": "Contact Us Socialism at Its Finest after Fed’s Bazooka Fails In what is being called the worst financial crisis since 1929 , the US stock market has lost a third of its value in the space of a month, wiping out all of its gains of the last three years. When the Federal Reserve tried to ride to the rescue, it only succeeded in making matters worse. The government then pulled out all the stops. To our staunchly capitalist leaders, socialism is suddenly looking good.\nT he financial crisis began in late February, when the World Health Organization announced that it was time to prepare for a global pandemic. The Russia-Saudi oil price war added fuel to the flames, causing all three Wall Street indices to fall more than 7 percent on March 9. It was called Black Monday, the worst drop since the Great Recession in 2008; but it would get worse.\nOn March 12, the Fed announced new capital injections totaling an unprecedented $1.5 trillion in the repo market, where banks now borrow to stay afloat. The market responded by driving stocks 8% lower.\nOn Sunday, March 15, the Fed emptied its bazooka by lowering the fed funds rate nearly to zero and announcing that it would be purchasing $700 billion in assets, including federal securities of all maturities, restarting its quantitative easing program. It also eliminated bank reserve requirements and slashed Interest on Excess Reserves (the interest it pays to banks for parking their cash at the Fed) to 0.10%. The result was to cause the stock market to open on Monday nearly 10% lower. Rather than projecting confidence, the Fed’s measures were generating panic.\nAs financial analyst George Gammon observes , the Fed’s massive $1.5 trillion in expanded repo operations had few takers. Why? He says the shortage in the repo market was not in “liquidity” (money available to lend) but in “pristine collateral” (the securities that must be put up for the loans). Pristine collateral consists mainly of short-term Treasury bills. The Fed can inject as much liquidity as it likes, but it cannot create T-bills, something only the Treasury can do. That means the government (which is already $23 trillion in debt) must add yet more debt to its balance sheet in order to rescue the repo market that now funds the banks.\nThe Fed’s tools alone are obviously incapable of stemming the bloodletting from the forced shutdown of businesses across the country.\nThe Fed’s tools alone are obviously incapable of stemming the bloodletting from the forced shutdown of businesses across the country. Fed chair Jerome Powell admitted as much at his March 15 press conference, stating, “[W]e don’t have the tools to reach individuals and particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work …. We do think fiscal response is critical.” “Fiscal policy” means the administration and Congress must step up to the plate.\nWhat about using the Fed’s “nuclear option” – a “helicopter drop” of money to support people directly? A March 16 article in Axios quoted former Fed senior economist Claudia Sahm: The political ramifications of the Fed essentially printing money and giving it to people – there are ways to do it, but the problem is if the Fed does this and Congress still has not passed anything … that would mean the Fed has stepped in and done something that Congress didn’t want to do. If they did helicopter money without congressional approval, Congress could, and rightly so, end the Fed.\nThe government must act first, before the Fed can use its money-printing machine to benefit the people and the economy directly. The Fed, Congress and the Administration Need to Work as a Team\nOn March 13, President Trump did act, declaring a national emergency that opened access to as much as $50 billion “for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average responded by ending the day up nearly 2,000 points, or 9.4 percent.\nThe same day, Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard proposed a universal basic income of $1,000 per month for every American for the duration of the crisis. She said, “Too much attention has been focused here in Washington on bailing out Wall Street banks and corporate industries as people are making the same old tired argument of how trickle-down economics will eventually help the American people.” Meanwhile the American taxpayer “gets left holding the bag, struggling and getting no help during a time of crisis.” H.R. 897, her bill for an emergency UBI, she said was the most simple, direct form of assistance to help weather the storm.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who made a universal basic income the basis of his platform, would go further and continue the monthly payments after the coronavirus threat was over.\nCNBC financial analyst Jim Cramer also had expansive ideas. He said on March 12: How about a $500 billion Treasury issue … [at] almost no interest cost, to make sure that when people are sick they don’t have to go to work, and companies that are in trouble because of that can still make their payroll. How about a credit line backstopped by … the Federal Reserve. I know the Federal Reserve is going to say they can’t do that, Congress is going to say they can’t do that, everyone is going to say what they said in 2007, they can’t do that, they can’t do that — until they did it. … [W]e heard all that in 2007 and they ended up doing everything.\nAnd that looks like what will happen this time around. On March 18, as the stock market continued to plummet, the administration released an outline for a $1 trillion stimulus bill , including $500 billion in direct payments to Americans, along with bailouts and loans for the airline industry, small businesses, and other “critical” sectors of the U.S. economy.\nBut the details needed to be hammered out, and even that whopping package buoyed the markets only briefly . In the bond market, yields shot up and values went down, on fears that the flood of government bonds needed to finance this giant stimulus would cause bond values to plummet and the government’s funding costs to shoot up. Extraordinary Measures for Extraordinary Times\nThere is a way around that problem. To avoid driving the federal debt into the stratosphere, the Treasury could borrow directly from the central bank interest-free, with an agreement that the debt would remain on the Fed’s books indefinitely. That approach has been tested in Japan, where it has not generated price inflation as austerity hawks have insisted it would. The Bank of Japan has purchased nearly 50 percent of the government’s debt, yet consumer price inflation remains below the BOJ’s 2 percent target.\nVirtually all money today is simply “monetized” debt – debt turned by banks into something that can be spent in the marketplace – and the ultimate backstop for this sleight of hand is the central bank and the government, which means the taxpayers. To equalize our very unequal system, the central bank and the government need to work together. The Fed needs to be “de-privatized” – turned into a public utility that serves the taxpayers and the economy. As Eric Striker observed in The Unz Review on March 13: The US government’s lack of direct control over the nation’s central bank and the plutocratic nature of our weak state means that common sense solutions are off the table. Why doesn’t the state buy up majority shares in large corporations (or outright nationalize them, as happened with the short successful experiment with General Motors in 2009) and use the $1.5 trillion at low interest to develop American industrial independence?\nInterestingly, that too could be on the table in these extraordinary times. Bloomberg reported on March 19 that Larry Kudlow, the White House’s top economic adviser, says the administration may ask for an equity stake (an ownership interest) in corporations that want coronavirus aid from taxpayers. Kudlow noted that when this was done with General Motors in 2008, it turned out to be a good deal for the federal government.\nWhile traditionally considered “anti-capitalist,” the government taking an ownership interest in bailed out companies may be the only way the proposed bailouts will get approval. There is little sentiment today for the sort of no-strings-attached “socialism for the rich” that the taxpayers shouldered in 2008 without reaping the benefits. Bloomberg quotes Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer at DoubleLine Capital: I don’t think government bailouts of over-leveraged companies that got over-leveraged by share buybacks at all-time highs, enriching executives and hedge fund investors, will sit well with the American people.\nThe Bloomberg article concludes with a quote from another chief investment officer, Chris Zaccarelli of Independent Advisor Alliance: I like how [the administration is] thinking a little bit outside of the box. Something big and bold like that could potentially be what turns the market around …. Long-term Solutions\nRather than just a stake in the profits, the government could think a bit further outside the box and turn insolvent airlines, oil companies, and banks into public utilities. It could require them to serve the people and the economy rather than just maximizing the short-term profits of their shareholders.\nConcerning the banks, the Fed could do as the People’s Bank of China is doing in this crisis. The state-run PBoC is giving regional banks $79 billion in stimulus money, but it is on condition that they lend it to small and medium enterprises and forgive late payments, so that economic damage is reversed and production can recover quickly.\nAnother model worth studying is that of Germany, which also has a strong public banking system. As part of a package for coronavirus aid that the German finance minister calls its “big bazooka,” the government is offering immediate access to loans up to €500,000 for small businesses through its public bank, the KfW (Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau), administered through the publicly-owned Sparkassen and other local banks. The loans are being made available at an interest rate as low as 1%, with interest only for the first two years.\nContrast that to the aid package President Trump announced last week, which will authorize the Small Business Administration to offer business loans. After a lengthy process of approval by state authorities, the loans can be obtained at an interest rate of 3.75% – nearly 4 times the KfW rate. German and Chinese public banks are able to offer rock-bottom interest rates because they have cut out private middlemen and are not driven by the insatiable demand for shareholder profits. They can lend countercyclically to avoid booms and busts while supporting the economy as a whole.\nT he U.S., too, could create a network of publicly-owned banks backed by the central bank, which could lend into their communities at below-market rates. And this is the time to do it. Times of crisis are when change happens. When the Covid-19 scare has passed, we will have a different government, a different economy and a different financial system. We need to make sure that what we get is an upgrade that works for everyone.\nEllen Brown By Ellen Brown/Web of Debt posted on March 22, 2020 DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed here are those of the individual contributor(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LA Progressive, its publisher, editor or any of its other contributors.

      "text": "Kristin Iversen Photo: Noam Galai/Getty Images. The oldest millennials were just entering adulthood — finishing high school, starting college, leaving home for the first time — on September 11, 2001, when terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., precipitated 18 years (and counting) of unconscionable war, and a horrific new reality suffused with persistent, ambient catastrophe. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, one message — whether delivered by President George W. Bush or New York City’s then-new mayor, Michael Bloomberg, or Vogue editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour ( no, really ) — persisted: The best way to help out yourself, your community, and your country, is to buy stuff. Advertisement In the intervening years, as more millennials have entered adulthood, they’ve heard this mandate come down again and again. It was invoked after natural disasters, like hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and during man-made disasters like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the recession that started in December 2007. Again and again, we’ve been told that the way we can save ourselves — and save the world — is by shopping. Millennials, specifically, have also been told to be grateful for how little is being asked of us; we’re reminded that, in prior years, Americans were asked to give their lives for some notion of the greater good. Now we’re just asked to give our money. The idea that money and life — or at least the American way of living it — exist in some deranged 21st-century binary is, of course, ridiculous. There’s no way to separate them, no way anymore to even conceptualize a choice like “your money or your life.” As anyone who’s been asked to contribute to a GoFundMe for someone who can’t afford basic medical care knows, money is life, and, all too often, a lack of it means death. But while money has always represented more than just someone’s livelihood, what has become crystal clear in recent years is the way in which we’ve become inured to the idea that it is our personal duty to support an all-too precarious system, rather than have any expectations of a social safety net. It’s not just that we are on our own, it’s that we’re supposed to feel pride in being on our own — as if, even if the government offered to help, we should want to reject it. Advertisement This way of thinking is a part of disaster capitalism, a concept outlined by Naomi Klein in her 2007 book, The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism . Disasters, Klein explains, are a regular enough occurrence that the American government and business elites realized that they needed to find a way to exploit them in order to maintain the status quo, and their own lofty positions of privilege. This is because, Klein says, during times of extreme economic distress, when it becomes clear that our institutions are failing us, people naturally look for more progressive solutions, a way to ensure a common good; this is what happened following the 1929 stock market crash, which led to the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the advent of the New Deal. Disasters are a fact of life, though, and rather than risk a more progressive future, the American government — conservative and liberal, alike — has deployed what Klein calls the “shock doctrine,” and used disasters for political gain, by exploiting instability, asking financially precarious people to contribute all they have, and ensuring the wealthy elite will be the only ones who benefit. It’s the continued prioritization of the private interest over the public good, and it’s been an ascendent philosophy for every millennials’ adulthood. We’ve been told over and over that the only way out of trauma is by burning through our dwindling checking accounts. (Savings, what are those?) However, with the coronavirus pandemic, the American brand of disaster capitalism might have met its match. Advertisement One of the tenets of disaster capitalism is that it is necessary for most people to continue to act normally — keep patronizing businesses both local and online, frequent restaurants and coffee shops, and, you know, take that vacation anyway! Hop on that cruise ship! You, like, deserve it. Advising people to do this works in two ways: They spend money, and have the illusion of control over an uncontrollable situation. And there’s no doubt that it does actually help small and local businesses when they have dedicated patrons. But what the coronavirus pandemic is proving once and for all, is that this help not only isn’t going to be enough, but that it should never be the responsibility of individual consumers to keep the economy afloat — especially when so many of them suddenly find themselves un- or under-employed, and financially unstable. That is exactly where we find ourselves now, and it’s a place none of us — but particularly not millennials — have ever experienced. So, perhaps it makes sense that many of us, particularly those young enough not to feel like like we are in immediate danger from COVID-19, first responded to the threat of a pandemic by going out, frequenting bars, shopping as normal — this is what we knew to do in prior times of panic. But the unique circumstances of this virus have put a stop to that kind of behavior. Still, though, our impulse to shop our way out of this disaster remains strong. As it’s become undeniable that entire industries — from restaurants and bars to independent bookstores to indie fashion brands to beauty salons — are threatened with decimation, it’s become similarly undeniable that orders of curbside margaritas and gift cards are not the cure. Yes, we should still shop local and support small businesses , but that is not nearly enough — especially when some of those small businesses might manage to stay afloat, but will also do so by laying off workers who will not get to see any of the money that comes from those gift cards we buy, and will lose health insurance in the process. Advertisement So what can we do to feel like we have some sort of power at a time where we also feel wholly restrained? As Klein recently told Vice , “instead of hoarding and thinking about how you can take care of yourself and your family, you can pivot to sharing with your neighbors and checking in on the people who are most vulnerable.” You can also demand more from a government that is, as we speak, figuring out how they want to profit from this disaster, and determining from which aspect of the shock doctrine do they stand to benefit the most. The last time we faced something similarly catastrophic was in 2008, when the economy went into free-fall, tens of thousands of Americans lost their homes, and even more lost their jobs. Although that period led to an increase in political organizing (as seen with Occupy Wall Street), which did prove beneficial (the Occupy movement was instrumental in helping people in New York City affected by Hurricane Sandy), it was also treated as another opportunity to cut social services and support big business — like all those banks that were deemed “too big to fail.” Now, things are different. Yes, there are still billionaire hedge funders like Bill Ackman excoriating Americans to ride out this pandemic by ordering as much Chipotle as possible. (Ackman's hedge fund holds a 5 percent ownership in Chipotle .) But, there are signs that even the usual suspects are willing to try unorthodox methods when dealing with this crisis, by doing things like proposing huge stimulus bills and flirting with the idea of a Universal Basic Income. They have no choice, these are extraordinary times, and the ramifications of this pandemic remain incomprehensible, although one thing seems clear: People without health insurance will die. Advertisement So, it is not going to be enough to get a couple thousand dollars offered as a balm for a month of staying indoors. We must demand that healthcare not be tied to employment or relationship status. We must demand protection for the most vulnerable among us. We must demand accountability from those who would materially profit from the deaths of others. We must resist the impulse to hoard our personal resources — whether they be rolls of toilet paper or the energy and ability to protest — and act according to a desire to benefit the most people as possible. We must understand that our inclination to shop is not a personal flaw, but a small business and its employees should be protected — through a time like this, yes, but also just in general — by a safety net stronger than its customers’ disposable income. Because unless you’re Jeff Bezos or Michael Bloomberg, you probably don’t have the personal wealth to keep an industry afloat on your own. And that’s okay. Millennials have answered our government’s call to go shopping for long enough. Now it’s time for the government to answer ours, and provide us with the future we want, and need. COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic. Go to the NHS website for the latest information on symptoms, prevention, and other resources. Related Content:",

      "text": "As I swipe through my news feed and stories, I find it tiring to keep consuming content.\nSo, I decided to write me a post to jot down the random thoughts that came into my mind during this pandemic. It is, after all, during times of crisis that reflective thinking is important, that we can deeply inspect and learn more about our tendencies and life values or philosophies.\nThis will be a free writing, stream-of-consciousness style of writing as I would like my thoughts to be as raw and as unfiltered as possible. Here goes.\nAs I’m typing, I ought to feel very privilege and blessed to be healthy and (in a way) rich, to be able to afford a laptop and stable network connection, not to mention a room of my own, air-conditioned and well-lit. I have sufficient food to last me for a week during this movement restriction order period. Plus, I still have work to do and I still have my paycheck at the end of the month, to keep me going and sustain my livelihood.\nMy portfolio is sitting at -30% loss at the moment, but I’m thankful that I still have holding power as I still have my emergency savings to last me through winter, yet I do not know when would winter end. I grieved hard for the hard-earned money and the possible profit I could have make if I were to be smarter and quicker in handling my portfolio. Then again, who would have foresee this coming?\nAs I’m working from home, I don’t really get to spend much of my cash. The imaginary lifestyle of travelling, shopping, eating out, dressing up is all brought to an abrupt halt. These are luxuries that we want, but not necessarily need. This makes me wonder, if we do need so much money. If it is wise if we trade our time and probably happiness and satisfaction working on a day job we find depressing, for that stash of cash that you might not get to spend anyway.\nHow much money is enough?\nWhen we talk about money, we’ll inevitably touch the topic of work and having a career or building your career. But have you ever wondered what does your career or work means to you, other than a source of income? Some of us are fixated to rising the career ladder as a means to get a higher pay, which is no doubt true, but at what cost? If money is what we yearn for, there is surely other ways to earn. As we spend almost 8 to 10 hours in our day job, assuming you are an employee, what value are we creating? and are those values aligned with our values?\nAssuming if we live till a ripe age of 70 and if you’re in your mid-twenties, there’s at least 4 decades, 40 years for you to work on something. Of course, the thing is we never know what the future hold and we never know when we will go, especially with this pandemic and virus going around. If you do get it, and managed to recover, your lungs may not work as well as before. I certainly wish not to catch the virus, as I’m still looking to run a 100km.\nAnyway, this unsettling period is a good time to think about what really matters, and what is the purpose of living, which would vary between each individual. What drives your will to live? Is it ambition? Is it accomplishment? Is it making a mark, leaving a legacy? Is it fear of death? Why do you want to live? Or are you living because, you are? Are you just enduring life? I do sometimes feel like I’m just enduring life and when difficult times come, it feels hard to live on. I am still questioning the reason why I am waking up, going to work, eating, sleeping, bathing, and doing my routines. Maybe, we don’t need to have a reason to live and that is fine as well.\nI always told myself, if I had time, I’d definitely learn how to code and learn how to do digital painting and designing, learn Japanese, paint more, understand the stock market and investing, and do a whole bunch of things. During this period, I find myself not doing them, although I had so much time in my hands. I generally want to be a better person by improving myself. What is a better person though?\nA guideline that we can take is, as we look towards other, seeing that they are better, in what aspect are they better? We envy or admire what we wish to have or aspire to be. Being aware of whatever pushes our button would give us better control of ourselves and our mind. A very significant trend nowadays are people sharing their career successes, travelling photos, exquisite meals, expensive cars and houses, having a good-looking partner and in a blossoming relationship, and probably a great body, all signifying grandiosity and to a certain extent – excessiveness. Many of us strive towards achieving those things and sustaining it, seemingly – pleasurable things.\nWhat’s next though after attaining those seemingly unreachable things?\nI feel like I’m going off tangent. I may not even be alive in the next one year.\nWe can only hope and do the best we can.\n ",

There’s a shite ton of stocks you could probably put 50k in and make a lot of money. If I had a gun to my head and had to pick one I’d probably go Visa. You won’t make 200k off if it anytime soon though.\nIf I really had a gun to my head I’d panic and do the stock EGO that I’ve mentioned on here a few times since it’s cheap and you can buy a lot of shares and is almost half the price it was a month ago.",

      "text": "Colleges usually require students to send in a deposit by May 1 in order to hold a spot in the incoming freshman class. But some schools are offering more flexibility to students as the coronavirus crisis grows.Over the past week, more than 200 colleges and universities have said they'll push the deadline to at least June 1, according to a tally by a nonprofit group called ACCEPT (Admissions Community Cultivating Equity & Peace Today).Video above: Where does the money go? Breaking down the costs of collegeThat includes the highly-selective Williams College in Massachusetts, Gonzaga University in Washington, and the University of Illinois at Chicago.\"There is real financial uncertainty for everyone at this moment, and May 1 seems awfully close. Having that extra four weeks to process the decision is really invaluable,\" said Marie Bigham, the founder of ACCEPT and a former college admissions director. It's not just about paying the deposit, which can typically range between $500 and $1,000. Committing to a college means taking on the burden of tuition and other costs just as the economy is facing an unprecedented calamity — adding more pressure on prospective students trying to decide between schools.Millions of Americans' jobs are at risk and the stock market has plummeted, erasing nearly all gains made since President Donald Trump was sworn in.Families' 529 college savings accounts could be looking a lot smaller than they were just a month ago. On Friday, Trump said he would allow existing student loan borrowers to suspend student loan payments amid rising layoffs.New Jersey high school senior Jillian Moran said she spent a lot of time on the phone last week trying to better understand her financial aid award from Penn State.The boutique she works at after school has closed because of the coronavirus outbreak and she's worried about not having enough spending money saved up. She's feeling even more pressure because she was planning to start classes this summer.As of Friday, the college has not moved its May 1 decision deadline but explicitly told accepted students in an email not to come visit the campus in person. Moran has been to Penn State before, but never for a formal tour and was expecting to visit next month.\"I'm pretty freaked out. Everything is closing, there's no end in sight, and they're still going to ask me on May 1 whether or not I'm coming,\" Moran said.For those students who haven't yet visited their top-choice schools, making a decision about where to enroll will become more of a challenge now that they won't be able to get any face time with current students, admissions counselors or financial aid advisers.Gracyn Devine was planning to attend an admitted students day at the University of Rhode Island next weekend — until the college canceled the event and all tours, along with suspending in-person classes because of the coronavirus pandemic.Instead, Devine, a high school senior from New Jersey, visited the university on Friday with her parents. Hardly anyone was on campus, she said, but they were able to pick up a map from a mailbox outside the closed welcome center and use it to take their own self-guided tour.\"I really liked the campus — and I think that's a good sign if I liked it even when no one was there,\" said Devine, who's still trying to decide between the University of Rhode Island and the University of Delaware, which she's visited before.

      "text": "Hyderabad: The 24-hour extended voluntary Janata Curfew called by the Telangana State government on Sunday evoked very good response across the State with shops, hotels, markets and other business establishments remaining closed and people confining themselves to their homes.\nChief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a 14-hour Janata Curfew across the country as part the efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, had on Saturday urged people to observe a 24-hour self-imposed curfew from 6 am on Sunday till 6 am on Monday. People have also been asked to step out on their balconies or homes at 5 pm on Sunday to applaud the services rendered by those in the front line such as doctors, nurses and paramedics.\nAlso read Hyderabad city joins Janata Curfew Hyderabad: Janata Curfew evokes positive response in old city In Telangana State, all the roads including the State capital of Hyderabad, wore a deserted look right from the morning with only those involved in essential services like milk vendors, policemen and newspapers boys stepping out. Policemen in Hyderabad were seen holding placards that read “Good citizens support Janata curfew,” “Please pray from home,” “Avoid social gatherings” and the likes, sending a strong message to the people not only for the day but for the days to come in battling the deadly virus that has claimed thousands of lives across the globe.\nPublic transport including the TSRTC, Metro, taxicabs and auto rickshaws are also not in operation.\nReports from the districts said life had come to a standstill with people remaining indoors, and shops and other business establishments remaining shut. There was no movement of vehicles on both national and state highways.\nA report from Karimnagar, from where a group of 10 Indonesian preachers tested positive for coronavirus and were placed in an isolation ward in a designated hospital subsequently, said hotels, small kirana shops, supermarkets and other business establishments remained closed. The main as well as internal road in the town wore a deserted look.\nSome people, who were not aware about the cancellation of bus services, were seen waiting in the bus stand. Police, however, explained the situation to them and asked them to vacate the bus stand. A huge police deployment was seen in the town in places where crowds generally gather like bus stations, markets and business areas.\nKarimnagar Police Commisioner VB Kamalasan Reddy visited several areas in the town to take stock of the situation. People are voluntarily participating in the janata curfew, he observed and thanked the people of Karimnagar town for expressing their solidarity with the cause.\nThe situation was the same in all the other 32 district of the State.\nNow you can get handpicked stories from Telangana Today on WhatsApp / Telegram everyday.

      "text": "\nHope Marlene Custer\nA deadly virus, plummeting stock market, isolation—current news is certainly a reason for despair.\nIf you are feeling that your future is looking bleak, let me offer you some hope!\nHaving hope means you expect something good even though it seems impossible.\nWith the world in ‘meltdown mode,’ it is essential to turn to Scripture.\nA good example for us to look at is Jeremiah, the prophet during the last days before Judah went into exile.\nIt was not a popular thing to do to proclaim judgment and the imminent fall of a kingdom.\nAs dismal as circumstances were at this time, he still proclaimed that because he was confident in God’s love, he had hope. (Lamentations 3:21, 22 NIV)\nAs predicted by Jeremiah, Israel was taken into exile, but in God’s timing, the nation was restored.\nEventually, Israel’s greatest hope was realized in the coming of Jesus.\nAnd it is Jesus that we must turn to today.\nWe must repent and call upon Him to renew our hope.\nGod’s word reminds us, “Do not be anxious about anything, but ... present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:6,7 NIV)\nTo have peace of mind we must guard what we allow ourselves to dwell on.\nPaul admonishes believers to think about things that are “noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, or praiseworthy.”\nOh, God, this is a scary time in my life.\nPlease renew my hope and give me the faith to trust you for my future.\nHelp me to put negative thoughts out of my mind and think on the things that will make me stronger in You.\nMarlene is a retired teacher who desires to make Jesus known.

      "text": "In 1933, as Franklin D. Roosevelt took his oath of office as the 32nd President of the United States, his people were hurting. From Texas to Detroit to every state in between, citizens were struggling through a 25% unemployment rate, a series of natural disasters, widespread housing foreclosures and food shortages, a stock market that had tumbled by 90%, and little hope for recovery as the Great Depression took hold. Directed by gifted filmmaker Robert Stone, The Civilian Conservation Corps outlines one of the most daring and consequential of the public programs enacted by Roosevelt during this time, a tenant of the New Deal that continues to resonate in our modern world.\nUp until that time, the public did not necessarily look upon the government as an engine for bettering their daily lives. Roosevelt's New Deal restructured the function of the government in an unprecedented manner. As part of this string of new programs, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was designed to reward meaningful work while improving upon the environmental vitality of the nation. Toiling over a period of six months in labor camps across the country, program participants were paid a daily wage to plant trees, repair gullies and embark on other conversation projects. This was many years before environmentalism became one of the country's chief movements.\nRoosevelt looked upon the program as a win-win proposition; these efforts would enhance the value of the country's natural resources while keeping its most vulnerable citizens employed. Nevertheless, a vocal opposition did emerge, and blasted the president for ignoring the interests of business, deficit spending and corporate taxes.\nThe story of the CCC is vividly captured through a wealth of impressive archived materials and a series of new interviews with the men who signed up for the program up until the time of its demise in 1942. The narrative they weave is one of pride, prosperity and patriotism.\nThe Civilian Conservation Corps is a beautifully assembled and meticulously rendered slice of American history. But it is by no means a dry history lesson; instead, it makes this long-passed era feel personal and inspirational.\nDirected by : Robert Stone Buying the War Media - 83 min - ★ 8.77 Over a decade ago Bush administration forced the United...

      "text": "Washington • It’s not easy being a national treasure.\n“I’m exhausted,” confessed Dr. Anthony Fauci when I reached him Thursday evening in the middle of another 18-hour workday.\n“I have changed my tune a bit, probably thanks to my wife,” said the 79-year-old director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “About a week ago, I was going about four or five days in a row on about three hours of sleep, which is completely crazy, ’cause then I’ll be going on fumes. The last couple of nights, I’ve gotten five hours’ sleep, so I feel much better.”\nHe said he misses the endorphins of power walking, and he is wracked when he gets home at midnight and it’s too late to answer calls and emails.\n“I gotta get rid of this guilt feeling,” he murmured about that moment’s 727 emails.\nHe said he has not been tested for the coronavirus but takes his temperature every day and usually has it taken another couple times before White House press conferences and meetings in the Oval.\nWhen I spoke with him, he had been missing from the White House briefing for two days and Twitter blew a gasket, with everyone from Susan Rice to Laurence Tribe seeking an answer to the urgent query, “Where is Dr. Fauci?”\nDonald Trump, the ultimate “me” guy, is in a “we” crisis and it isn’t pretty. The president is so consumed by his desire to get back his binky, a soaring stock market, that he continues to taffy-twist the facts, leaving us to look elsewhere — to Fauci and governors like Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom — for leadership during this grim odyssey.\nFauci chuckled at speculation that he was banished due to his habit of pushing back on Trump’s hyperbolic and self-serving ad-libbing.\n“That’s kind of funny but understandable that people said, ‘What the hell’s the matter with Fauci?’ because I had been walking a fine line; I’ve been telling the president things he doesn’t want to hear,” he said. “I have publicly had to say something different with what he states.\n“It’s a risky business. But that’s my style, Maureen. You know me for many years. I say it the way it is, and if he’s gonna get pissed off, he’s gonna get pissed off. Thankfully, he is not. Interestingly.”\nArticle continues below Related Article s Maureen Dowd: Plagued by the president Maureen Dowd: Trump lives in a crazy fantasy world Maureen Dowd: Germaphobe Trump threatened by a virus Maureen Dowd: Trump should admire a movie about con artists who wreak chaos Maureen Dowd: Trump vs. Bloomberg is the battle of the meme girls The first time I talked to Fauci was during a panic in the mid-1980s about stopping another virus, the cause of the heartbreaking AIDS crisis. Then, as now, he was honest, brave and innovative. He told me that he tries to be diplomatic when he has to contradict the president about what “game-changer” cures might be on the horizon and whether everyone who wants to be tested can get tested.\n“I don’t want to embarrass him,” the immunologist said, in his gravelly Brooklyn accent. “I don’t want to act like a tough guy, like I stood up to the president. I just want to get the facts out. And instead of saying, ‘You’re wrong,’ all you need to do is continually talk about what the data are and what the evidence is.\n“And he gets that. He’s a smart guy. He’s not a dummy. So he doesn’t take it — certainly up to now — he doesn’t take it in a way that I’m confronting him in any way. He takes it in a good way.”\nOn Friday, a trigger-happy Trump was so quick to talk up the fabulous possibilities of an anti-malarial drug in combating the virus that Fauci had to pump the brakes , taking the microphone to explain that we do not know yet because controlled testing is needed.\nThe president returned to the lectern to press his unscientific case and compliment himself: “I’m a smart guy,” he said. “I feel good about it. And we’re going to see. You’re going to see soon enough.”\nProbably thinking about all his government staffers working round-the-clock, Fauci could not help rubbing his forehead and cheek — going against his own advice to the public — when Trump cracked a joke about the “Deep State Department.”\nAlthough the scientist listens respectfully when the president and the vice president are talking, he somehow manages to emit an “Oh my God, please don’t say that” vibe when the two men scamper over the line. When Mike Pence went into false-hope overdrive, saying, “I just can’t emphasize enough about the incredible progress that we have made on testing,” Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, the administration’s virus response coordinator, exchanged a whispered aside that sent the internet into a frenzy.\nFauci assured me that, despite their crosscurrents and an early overconfidence about how easy it would be to control the path of the virus, the president “absolutely” now gets the threat of “the invisible enemy,” as Trump calls the virus.\nStill, Trump managed to have an hourlong press conference about public health guidance in which he relentlessly ran afoul of public health guidance.\nHe wants to think of himself as a wartime president, but he can’t rise above his pettiness and defensiveness long enough to stop trashing White House reporters who are simply trying to do their job under perilous circumstances. He also can’t move away from his old standby, xenophobia.\nTrump has never understood anything about government, so he doesn’t know what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention versus the Food and Drug Administration versus the Federal Emergency Management Agency should do. His improvisational leadership style was vividly — and disturbingly — on display Friday during a call with Chuck Schumer, who urged him to invoke the Defense Production Act to get ventilators and masks to desperate states — despite the president’s cavalier remark a day earlier that the federal government is “not a shipping clerk” for the states. “Then POTUS yelled to someone in his office to do it now,” a Schumer spokesman reported.\nTrump is just a petrified salesman who believes in perception over reality. He thinks if he can create the perception that this is going to be a quick fix and there’s a little pill coming, then the stock market will roar back, along with his 2020 momentum.\nWith Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Great Depression, the only thing to fear was fear itself. With Trump and our new abyss, we have to fear not only fear but also the ignorance and misdirection of the White House and the profiteering of senators. Not to mention the virus.\nMaureen Dowd is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.",

      "text": "Nobody knows yet if this will be just a momentary blip in the area’s rising prosperity, or if the downturn will last a long time.\nRecession\n“What’s really going on is the economy is going into recession, that’s pretty clear,” said Patrick Barkey, director of the University of Montana’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research.\n“It’s a big shock to the system, it’s going to put enormous stress on households,” Barkey said. “There’s a lot of pressure on companies to make payroll and just survive.”\nBarkey added he’s grateful that leaders in Washington are taking action. Delaying the filing date for federal income taxes by three months was a good move.\n“Now is not the time to be worried about government deficits,” he said. “The national government can borrow money, print money.”\nHe does see some slivers of good news. The American consumer hasn’t gone away and still wants to buy goods. The widespread shutdown of in-person commerce opens opportunities for online businesses. More people are learning how to do their jobs online.\nOne bit of good news for Gallatin County, he said, is “there are a lot of very wealthy people in Gallatin and Madison counties,” especially around Big Sky, and they’re probably staying in large homes and still spending money in the local economy.\nYet even an economic anchor like MSU, which gives Bozeman a lot of stability, he said, will take some hits to its revenue from cancellations by sporting events, conferences and international students.\n“The bad news is, it’s not just Montana – it’s global,” Barkey said. “The good news is everything’s in place to bounce back, particularly the financial markets.\n“There is a loss of confidence — people are running for the exits in the stock market,” he said. “There is a period of fear. Once we get over the worst part of this, we’re in reasonably good shape to bounce back. … (Then) we can start to make bets on the future again.”\nBut for now, a lot of businesses and households are going to find it hard to weather the storm. Projects are going to be put on hold. People are afraid, especially afraid of anything that puts them in close contact with others.\n“The airline industry is on life support,” Barkey said. “It’s going to kill tourism, that’s going to be real tough. Who’s going to travel?”\nUncharted territory\nBefore the virus hit, Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport was “on track to have our best year ever,” said Brian Sprenger, airport director.\nBZN is by far Montana’s busiest airport, with more than 1.6 million passengers last year, almost as many as Billings and Missoula combined.\nNow, airlines are slashing the number of seats available to fly into Bozeman by 15% to 60%. There was an exodus of skiers when Big Sky closed. Conferences are being canceled, California, New York and other states are telling people to stay at home, and even Disneyland is closed.\nThat last time Sprenger saw such drastic cutbacks was 19 years ago, right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when airports reopened in just four days.\nSprenger said he’s hoping that business might gradually return to normal over the next year, but in the meantime he’s bracing for a potential worst case of an 80% reduction in passengers in April and May.\n“This is uncharted territory,” Sprenger said.\nThe good news is that there’s no need to disrupt the ongoing construction of the airport’s $30 million concourse expansion, already 75% complete. Construction workers can keep 6-feet of distance from others as they work.\nBut the airport also generates jobs for people working in gift shops, cafes, coffee shops, car rentals, cleaning and the like.\n“For anybody working a job that has a lack of a safety net, I’m very worried,” Sprenger said. “It’s going to impact individuals and small businesses.”\nBuilders busy\nConstruction workers are still busy at Langlas & Associates’ building sites, from the new $91 million Gallatin High School to Bozeman Health hospital’s new $20 million west end clinic, and the company plans to start in June on the $29 million reconstruction of Bozeman High.\nBut it’s not business as usual, said president Steve Langlas, for his 185 employees or dozens of subcontractors — electricians, plumbers and the like.\nFollowing Centers for Disease Control guidelines, there are hand-washing stations at job sites, and meetings with owners are being held by videoconference to avoid getting people in close proximity.\nAsked if he’s worried about the future, Langlas is cautious.\n“We shouldn’t have to lay anybody off unless stay-at-home restrictions like California’s and New York’s become implemented in Montana,” Langlas said.\nA friend in California told him there, unless people work in a few fields — like medicine, grocery stores or power plants — they aren’t supposed to go in to work.\n“It’s too early to tell” what may happen, Langlas said. “There have not been any major project cancellations.”\nCommercial and residential construction sites are still busy, said Crystal Fiedler, co-owner of Distinctive Lighting and president of the Southwest Montana Building Industry Association.\nSWMBIA has more than 200 members, from homebuilders to bankers, real estate agents, mortgage lenders and nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity, Fiedler said.\nThey have benefited for years from Bozeman’s building boom.\nIt helps that interest rates are low, she said, but a lot of potential buyers aren’t looking at properties. People have put off traveling for now.\n“We’ve seen people back out of something right now, because things are so unknown,” she said. A lot of people are “worried and scared and hunkered down.”\nShe personally tries to be optimistic, to look for opportunity and ways to be creative, to find solutions.\n“Everybody is going to be struggling,” Fiedler said. “We’re in it together.”\nIt’s too soon to tell the impact of the coronavirus on Bozeman’s real estate industry, said Claire Gillam, Realtor-broker with Berkshire Hathaway and president of the Gallatin Association of Realtors.\nBefore this week, real estate agents were really busy, gearing up for a great spring, she said.\nThe latest GAR report for February sales of single family homes reported that the median price in Gallatin County had increased 6.7% over the year before, up to $447,950. The number of days a home stayed on the market dropped to 75, a decrease of 23%.\nMortgage rates are an all-time low – 3.75% for a 30-year loan, Gillam said. And Realtors know how to work from home and give online virtual tours of their properties.\n“I got a couple buy-sell agreements this week,” she said. “I have a few closings. It’s still happening.”\nStill, she said, “there’s a lot of scared people.”\nGillam recalled hearing a speaker at a Bozeman Area Chamber of Commerce dinner say that more than half of the people moving here don’t depend on local jobs for their income. Instead they’re retired, telecommute or are independently wealthy.\n“I’m still hopeful,” Gillam said. “I think there will be a couple of rocky quarters, (but) we’re still a target,” a community people want to move to.\nLove in the time of coronavirus\nDowntown Bozeman wasn’t exactly a ghost town this past week, but the handful of folks ambling along the sidewalks passed each other at a distance, drifting by like tumbleweeds.\n“It’s crazily empty,” said Ariana Paliobagis, owner of the Country Bookshelf independent bookstore for nearly 10 years.\nRestaurants, bars and distilleries were closed, but Owenhouse Ace Hardware and many retail shops remained open. Coffee shops advertised on sidewalk chalkboards that they were still offering takeout lattes.\n“Foot traffic has fallen off dramatically,” Paliobagis said. “But our phones are ringing and we’re getting online orders. We’re doing everything we can to keep everybody employed.”\nThe Country Bookshelf is responding creatively to coronavirus restrictions — offering free deliveries in Bozeman and Livingston, offering customers the chance to call in orders and pick them up at curbside on Main Street, and offering $1 shipping to send books anywhere in the country.\nSince it can’t hold author events, the Bookshelf is planning a virtual meet-up with husband-wife writers David Quammen, author of “Spillover,” on the Ebola epidemic, and Betsy Gaines Quammen, author of “American Zion,” on Cliven Bundy and those who distrust government and science. It will be on Facebook Live, March 25, at 6 p.m.\nThe bookstore has about 10 employees, but isn’t filling a recent vacancy and isn’t hiring summer help. This week it reduced shop hours to 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Right now she has no plans to close, unless ordered to do so.\n“I’m very, very concerned,” Paliobagis said. “I’ve hardly slept for days. … It could affect us for months, or years. It’s definitely going to put us in a recession. It will affect tourism. It will affect every business in the community. This is a long-term game we’re playing.”\nFor her, the silver lining has been the heartwarming actions of customers and fellow business owners.\n“We’ve had the sweetest response from customers; they’ve sent us lovely email,” Paliobagis said. “Wild Crumb sent us a beautiful pie today.\n“Businesses are reaching out, sharing love, asking how they can support local businesses. There are a lot of beautiful ways people are reaching out and helping each other.”\nMAP Brewing is also getting creative, trying to help its laid off employees.\nRodman said they just designed a T-shirt to sell for $25 apiece to raise money for an employee relief fund. The shirt has a stylized hops image on the front and “Brewing Local Support” on the back. He hopes to start selling shirts online next week and deliver them to people’s homes for free.\nAnd he’s glad to give an order to the local T-shirt company, also facing hard times.\n“Their company has come grinding to a halt, too,” Rodman said. “One hundred percent of the proceeds will go to the employee fund. We’re hoping to raise a few thousand dollars.\n“It’s been so tumultuous,” Rodman said. “It’s heart-breaking laying off 40 people.”\nGail Schontzler 582-2633.",

      "text": "Obama economist says there's 'a real danger' the looming coronavirus recession could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis Mar. 22, 2020, 11:09 AM\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters Obama's former top economist is warning the economic crisis that results from the coronavirus could be worse than the 2008 financial disaster. \"There is a real danger that the economic crisis that comes out of this health crisis is worse than what we experienced in 2008,\" Furman told Business Insider in an interview. Business Insider talked to Furman about the likelihood of recession, and how long it could take for the economy to dig itself out into a state of recovery. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .\nThe former top economist to President Obama is warning the coronavirus pandemic could throw the economy into a tailspin that's significantly worse than the financial disaster in 2008 - and believes its almost certainly in recession already .\nIn the past seven days, stocks continued their free-fall and recorded its worst finish since the financial crisis. Congress is scrambling to construct a colossal federal rescue package that may carry a price tag surpassing $1 trillion as economists warn layoffs are soaring and entire industries could be demolished in the fallout.\nThat type of chaos is familiar terrain for Jason Furman. Now at a professor at Harvard University, he helped shape the Obama administration's $800 billion stimulus package during the recession in 2009. Furman was later appointed to head the Council of Economic Advisors.\nYet the situation now is remarkably different. Businesses across the nation have shuttered in a bid to slow the spread of infections. Around one in four Americans were urged to stay home Saturday, effectively freezing substantial economic activity.\nBusiness Insider talked to Furman about a recession resulting from a virus that's shut down vast sectors of the economy and sent unemployment claims skyrocketing . He also offered a forecast for how long the economic pain might last and what lawmakers in Washington should put into the stimulus bill taking shape.\nThe interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Questions are in bold and all responses are from Furman.\nCongress is in the middle of designing a massive stimulus package to shore up an economy being ravaged by coronavirus. Many economists are saying we're already in a recession. Could the situation we face be worse than the 2008 financial crisis?\nThere is a real danger that the economic crisis that comes out of this health crisis is worse than what we experienced in 2008. There is a complete shutdown of economic activity across the entire planet that happened in a synchronized fashion of a type we've never seen before.\nI don't think though that the terrible scenarios are inevitable. It will depend on what happens with the pandemic and also on the economic policy response.\nRead more : GOLDMAN SACHS: Buy these 15 cheap, cash-rich stocks in order to dominate the market, even as we barrel towards recession\nWe got unemployment data that showed 281,000 claims were filed in the week ending March 14. Goldman Sachs is forecasting that 2.25 million Americans will file for benefits this week. What do you make of those figures, and are we already in a recession?\nThe United States is almost certainly in a recession. The last week has to have been the sharpest deterioration of economic activity in a single week that we've ever experienced. And that was done on purpose in order to stop the spread of the virus, so that's not a surprise. The really big question is how long it lasts.\nThat leads into my next question. How would you craft a legislative response that cushions the blow?\nFirst, you want to start with some general principles. It's better to be too big than too small. We don't know what exactly will or won't work, so you need to diversify your response. You need to have a response that continues and scales up as necessary.\nFinally, if at all possible, keep it simple. It's really hard to design programs in a hurry, it's even harder to design it when the people doing so are teleworking and social distancing - and their children aren't in school. So keeping it simple is really important.\nIn terms of fiscal stimulus, there are three broad uses of money. One is relief to individuals: You can do that through checks or unemployment insurance, nutritional assistance, paid leave. A second big bucket is continuity for businesses. Loans, grants, those various combinations.\nThe third bucket and the one I think has been most neglected to date is assistance to states and localities, which are going to see their revenues slammed at the same time expenditures they need to make are growing.\nYou've notably called for the federal government to send $1,000 checks to every American adult and help people weather the economic fallout from coronavirus. Why do you believe that's an effective way of bolstering the economy?\nChecks are an important part of the answer, but only one part. What makes them important is they are administratively feasible, the government can do it. They are broad in that they err on the side of ensure not missing people rather than erring on the side of missing people.\nRead more : Bank of America lays out the 6 things that need to happen for the stock-market crash to truly end - and warns only 4 have occurred so far\nThey're also scalable. You can make them larger if you need to. For all of these reasons, they're critical for both social insurance in the short-run to protect people - and give people more spending power to help the economy grow out of this in the medium- and long-run.\nIs it possible that checks may not reach people fast enough?\nThe faster you can get people money, the better. Unemployment insurance and nutritional assistance could be faster, but they miss a lot of people. The sooner the better for checks, but I wouldn't say don't do them, because it takes a month and a half.\nPeople also have some ability to delay paying their bills. I hope there's a lot of generosity in terms of late fees under the current circumstance. If you know a pot of money is coming a month and a half from now, I think that is a big relief in the situation we're facing.\nThe Senate Republican plan released on Thursday includes a provision that would send $1,200 checks to taxpayers as long as they earn less than $99,000 a year. Is means-testing for the money a good idea?\nIt's a good idea. My concern is that it would slow down delivery of the checks. In talking to people, and it appears Treasury knows the answer to this, and it thinks it won't slow them down. Means-testing is completely appropriate.\nHow would you grade the Trump administration's economic response? Letter grade?\nCompared to historical precedent, they've been fast. Compared to what's needed, they've been behind the curve and slow - five days behind which is an eternity in the current situation.\nCan I give them a letter grade? A lot of universities are shifting to pass/fail this semester, and they're on track to pass.\nHow concerned are you that gig workers and hourly-wage earners will catch the worst of the economic fallout we're seeing? What can government do to alleviate the pain?\nThe United States went into this crisis with an inadequate social safety net. It didn't have great portable benefits for gig workers, it didn't have a paid leave system. Unemployment insurance has the lowest coverage rate its had in a half-century.\nRead more : 'We have not had a single loser': An investment chief who's earned up to 90% per trade during the coronavirus crash breaks down his strategy - and explains why it will profit through the election\nRight now, there's not a lot of great mechanisms for getting to among others, gig workers. That's part of the motivation for the checks - that will go to everyone. I'm not sure there's something else you can specifically design, but I'd be thrilled if people prove me wrong.\nWe've been advised by public health experts to stay home for the immediate future. How long can the economy weather a shutdown of public life as we've known it?\nI think if the shutdown gets much past two months, I would have exponentially increasing worries about the long-term impact on the economy. But that's why an even bigger, sharper shutdown than we've had already is an investment in buying time so we need less of a shutdown later.\nDo you believe the economy has the power to rebound quickly, as Trump has said recently in press conferences?\nA lot of economists talk about a V-shaped recovery - you go down quickly, you go up quickly. That is generally not the way business cycles work. Generally you go down a lot faster than you go up, and that's because there's a lot of asymmetries in the economy.\nIf a worker gets fired, it takes time for them to get rehired. If a business goes bankrupt, it takes time for a business to reconstitute relationships that enable them to grow and thrive. For those reasons, large shocks to the economy tend to persist and last. I wouldn't count on a V-shaped recovery.\nThe best argument for a V-shaped recovery is the massive amount of support the economy is in the process of getting. That gives us a better shot at a rapid recovery. But it wouldn't be safe to assume one will happen.\nYou were part of the team that crafted the Obama administration's response in 2009 at the height of the recession. What lessons should policymakers draw from that era as they design a stimulus package that could very well surpass it in size and scope this time?\nGo big, go broad, go simple. I think those are some of the most important guiding principles. Make sure to stay at it as long as the economy needs it.\nOne of the problems in the response last time is that many in Congress, especially Republicans, just grew tired of fiscal stimulus and we stopped it too soon. I would not like to see that happen this time.",

      "text": "/ aspinalllucy\nI haven’t written anything for so long that I am feeling rusty, and didn’t really want my return to be a plague diary – but hey ho.\nOxfam is closed, so all those lovely books ( and indeed the not so lovely ones – Jeremy Clarkson included) will be sitting there waiting for new homes for some time to come (perhaps not Jeremy Clarkson…)\nMeanwhile, we usually are fans of hunkering down.\nAnd usually that comes with winter and log fires and telly and the dog asleep on some piece of furniture, a stew in the Aga and friends for a long Sunday lunch.\nNow it comes with all the above except it is Spring, and we can’t have anyone in the house.\nWe are the really privileged and I am seriously aware of that – we can afford to be where we are with no financial worries, we have a decent sized garden and are surrounded by fields.\nBut these are jittery times, strange times, no point of reference times, the calm before the storm times.\nThe times when you watch what is happening in Italy and marvel at the efforts being made to save lives and at the same time hope you never need to ask that for yourself or people you know.\nI’d like to think this was bringing out the best in me but just like my inner cleaner, I am finding it quite hard to locate by better inner self at the moment.\nBut here are two things that made my day:\nMy lovely next door neighbour managed by a slip of the cursor to get 4 kilos of carrots in her Ocado order.\nIn a few weeks time she’d probably be able to sell those on some black market for shares in Zoom, but right now she has given me some.\nMy BB, never knowingly cooking a thing in his life, and who has a sweet tooth which he has been nurturing for all his years, did not seem to run through the options of soup, purees, carrot curry ( but then who would?) and came up instantly with carrot cake. (Recipes that don’t involve cream cheese all welcome.)\nWe are also about to spend some happy hours filling envelopes with advice and support stuff from our Parish Council for the locals, and another lovely neighbour offered to help.\nNow normally, I would have flapped my hands and asked half the village in to help but had to say that we would manage.\nShe said, it would all go better with a glass of wine and I said, we should have stocked up with more of the white stuff – ten minutes later, a lovely bottle was delivered to our doorstep.\nThat will make today fine. Hope yours is too. Share this:",

      "text": "Over the past month, you have often come across headlines such as “The markets have lost 30% off their value”, “Dow finishes down to mark worst week since 2008”, etc. Marriott CEO said this is worse than 2008 and post 9/11 combined . All such headlines trigger an immediate reaction in the minds of the average investor – Where should I put my funds so that they are safe? Even perceived safe assets like investment grade bonds and municipal bonds are under severe distress.\nAmidst high panic and fear, investors tend to sell off their positions in the stock markets at losses so that the volatility of the markets doesn’t bother them. However, this loss aversion attitude in the short term leads to significant losses in the long run. Statistics have borne out that risk aversion runs higher than the greed impulse. Some estimate that the pain of losing is twice as strong an emotion than the joy of winning. To cut down their losses, investors may end up making wrong investment decisions, which can have severe repercussions in future. The stock markets are highly dynamic in nature. Every bull run leads to a bear market and there is a bull market waiting at the end of the bearish phase. Historically, the total duration of bull phase has been much higher than the bear phase. To earn profits in the stock market, the trick is to stay calm during periods of volatility. The key is to act decisively during downturns rather than being misguided by hysteria. When, the market does bottom- which it will, there will be no bell ringing the all clear.\nVanguard conducted a study to find 10-year returns of investors who adopted different strategies during the last recession of 2007 – 2009. One investor chose to sell all holdings and put their cash into savings accounts. The second investor opted for bonds while the third investor continued to hold the 50-50 stock-bond portfolio.\nThe cumulative returns were the highest for the third investor with investments in stocks and bonds. The initial investment of $1 million grew to $1.9 million over the 10-year period, implying an aggregate return of 90%. On the other hand, the first investor liquidated all holdings during the bearish phase. Over the 10-year period, the first investor incurred a net loss as the initial investment of $1 million was worth $729,214 only at the end. The first investor acted out of fear and incurred a net loss of 27% over the 10-year period.\nFear and panic interfere with the rational thinking and leads to decisions which can hurt significantly in the long run. Amidst volatility, the best action of an average investor is inaction. Staying calm during the bear phase would generate significant rewards in the long run. One way of keeping calmer is to have six months to a year of living expenses in cash so you don’t have to liquidate stocks or distressed bonds.\nSome will choose an aggressive approach. In the words of the legendary investor Warren Buffett, “be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.” I wish I knew what Buffett was doing now. Of course, you can buy Berkshire Hathaway stock itself.\nAnother approach is to watch what insiders are doing with their own money. And they are buying. This is the highest level of insider buying to selling since 2008 but it has not reached that level yet. Since this current crisis is far worse, I’d wouldn’t wave the all clear until it exceeds that level. They may not have a better crystal ball about the Coronavirus than you or I, but they certainly have a better understanding of their business. That’s the basis of The Insiders Fund .\nIf you want to take a passive approach, investments in ETFs are also a good option. Many ETFs like the tech sector ETFs, energy sector and financial ETFs -even staid utility ETFs as well as broad market ETFs have witnessed substantial declines in price. So, start your research today. This is uncharted territory. No bear market every feels like it’s going to end, but they do- and sometimes violently to the upside.\nWhat is important to realize is that all stocks will not march in lock stop with one another. For example, airline stocks during last Friday’s rout were mostly unchanged or even up. That’s a strong signal of a bottom in the group but one day in this new world is not sufficient enough to call a trend. Share this: ",

      "text": "Since February 19, stock markets have been falling, with the series of roller coaster sessions leaving investors reeling. In the last two weeks, markets fell in six out of ten trading sessions, and the drops were larger than the gains. The S&P 500 finished Friday’s trading session down by 4.4%, and hit a three-year low.\nFalling markets, however difficult they may be for traders’ portfolio values and companies’ market caps, can be accommodated. Investors can get used to lower stock prices, or can switch to bearish strategies to cope. The bigger question now is, will the economy as a whole get pushed into a recession, and if so, how long will it last?\nThese questions are urgent. Goldman Sachs is sounding a red alert, warning of a possible 24% contraction in the US economy for Q2 2020. Not every business sector lends itself to remote work, and those workers don’t have the opportunity now to go out and spend – while the services supported and provided by ‘nonessential workers’ are shutting down. Coronavirus may not be a particularly dangerous disease for everyone, but it’s clearly having an enormous impact.\nImpact, however, does not have to mean irreparable damage. You can rescue your portfolio, with some judicious stock choices. We’ve used the TipRanks Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool to find out which stocks the market’s insiders are snapping up, with a view to the long-term and the post-coronavirus recovery. Here are three of their favorite choices.\nFed E x Corporation ( FDX )\nGovernment-ordered shutdowns and quarantines are hurting FedEx for the obvious reasons. The shipping company is seeing less business – stores are ordering less stock, people facing layoffs are placing fewer online orders. As manufacturing begins to return in Asia, conditions are worsening in Europe. Uncertainty is the word of the day for FedEx.\nThe company’s fiscal Q3 report, covering the period ending February 29, showed a miss on earnings. The $1.41 reported was 5.4% below the $1.49 expected, and less than half the $3.03 shown in the year-ago quarter. Revenues did better, as the $17.5 billion reported was up 2.8% from the year before. The strong revenues reassured investors, and the stock gained after the report; nevertheless, FDX shares are down 27% so far this year.\nOn a positive note, FDX has kept its 18-year record of reliable dividend payments. The company maintained its 65-cent quarterly payment, announced on March 6 and due out on April 1. The annualized payment of $2.60 gives a yield of 2.34%, higher than the ~2% average among S&P listed peer companies – and far higher than bond yields.\nAdditionally, at least one insider is bullish on FDX. Board of Directors member John Edwardson has been snapping up shares for the last six months – and his most recent purchase, just last week, was significant to say the least– he shelled out $560,200 for 5,000 shares. This brings his total holding in FedEx to more than 82,000 shares, worth over $9 million. Clearly, Edwardson sees the advantages outweighing the negatives here.\nSome of Wall Street’s top analysts would agree. Writing for Cowen, 5-star analyst Helane Becker sees long-term benefits for FedEx: “Social distancing is accelerating the growth of ecommerce, a trend FedEx is well positioned to benefit from. The continued restriction of passenger air travel to certain regions has resulted in reduced belly capacity, leaving an opening for shippers like FedEx to grab share… the company notes Asia manufacturing has started to come back, which should drive increased demand for FedEx's international export service…”\nBecker shows some caution by reducing her price target to $156, but still sees an impressive 40% upside potential for the coming year, and maintains her Buy rating on the stock. (To watch Becker’s track record, click here )\nCredit Suisse analyst Allison Landry , also rated 5-stars by TipRanks, is more bullish, backing her Buy rating with a price target of $159 – suggesting an upside of 43%.

      "text": "\nGlobal Financial System Broken & Bankrupt\nGreg Hunter\nFinancial and precious metals expert Egon von Greyerz (EvG) operates the largest private gold vault in the world in Switzerland. More than a year and a half ago, EvG warned here on USAWatchdog.com that “risk is exponential and unmeasurable” because of the estimated two quadrillion of derivatives and debt in the global financial system. He also warned that “at some point, all hell will break loose.” Looks like hell has indeed broken loose because of the China virus, and now EvG contends, “The system is bankrupt. . . . The system is broken and bankrupt.\nThis did not start now with the Coronavirus. It didn’t start in August and September (of 2019) when central banks said we would do everything we can with the Fed QE, repos and the ECB (European Central Bank) QE. . . . This started a long time ago. The system was broken at the beginning of this century. The 2007-2009 crisis was the first signal that the financial system was not functioning. They threw $25 trillion at it in financing and guarantees, etc., but I always said 2007-2009 was a rehearsal. We are now approaching, sadly, the real thing. This is the end of a two to three hundred year cycle. So, we are going to see some extremely difficult times. The Corona virus is a horrible catalyst, but that is all it is. It’s not the reason for the problem. The reason for the problem is a broken financial system . . . and now we are starting the final stage of the end of this financial system.”\nEvG also says the reaction to the China virus is the same worldwide. EvG says, “You are seeing food shops with empty shelves. People are panicking. So, that is the first reaction to the Coronavirus, but they have not realized the big problem is in the financial markets. It is in a system that has no liquidity or money, and it has to print more and more. At some point, people will realize there is no money, and you will have the same reaction. People will be lining up outside of banks or they will go to their ATM machines to get money and, of course, they will have to reduce it. Now, in most countries, there is no cash. So, it is easy for them to shut off the system. There will absolutely be shortages of cash for people, otherwise, you will have bank runs.”\nEvG contends, “They have managed to maintain totally false markets with no real price discovery, certainly since 2009, by just flooding the market with so much money. We don’t have any real markets. We don’t have any real prices. It’s all fake. It’s all fake because it’s all supported by fake money.”\nEvG also predicts that before it’s over, the stock market will be down 90% or more. EvG says, “In 1929, the market crash took 2 ½ years to go down 90%. The bubble is much bigger now, so it could go very, very fast. . . . The risk is at a level now where the world cannot be saved.”\n",

      "text": "California is experiencing the single longest economic growth period in its history. The housing values in Fallbrook have been steadily climbing since the first quarter of 2009.\nThe last few years have seen 2% increments, but values have continued to rise. As a seller, the current value of your home has met or exceeded where it was in 2005-2006. Homes priced above $750,000 experienced the largest sales increase ever reported.\nMost sellers who contact the office are moving out of California. They are looking for a place with lower taxes, so their retirement nest egg will last longer. They are prepared to forgo the great weather in Fallbrook for a less expensive and more comfortable lifestyle.\nPrices in these new locations are noticeably lower than in California, which is why people are considering Idaho, Texas, Tennessee, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, North and South Carolina, Florida and Georgia.\nOwning real estate provides a clear safe harbor for gaining wealth. The stock market is showing its vulnerability, with both the steepest loss since October 1987’s “Black Monday,” falling 27.6% and the biggest gain since October 1987, climbing over 9%, all in the same week. All that said, real estate value continues to remain stable in Fallbrook.\nInterest rates have also shown volatility this past week. Reaching a low of 3%, leading to enormous volumes of refinance business, which prompted the banks to artificially raise rates due to their lack of liquidity. The most recent 100-point drop-in interest rates by Federal Reserve, should eventually move the mortgage rates back closer to 3%, but how soon is unclear.\nDespite the volatility, current interest rates remain near 4% which is historically low. These low interest rates do not just benefit buyers. When interest rates drop, it expands the pool of buyers who can afford your home. There currently is over a 2-point spread between the 10-year Treasury bond and the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, which would predict that there might be additional reductions in mortgage interest rates.\nIn January, the Federal Housing Administration loan limit increased to $701,500 and Veterans Affairs loans have no limit. Inventory levels are less than 50% of normal and the current month’s supply of detached homes is a scant 2.5 months, which benefits sellers.\nA balanced market has a six-month supply. Buyers are braving this challenging market in large numbers, so why are sellers waiting on the sidelines?\nPut all of this together, in the hands of a professional Realtor with strong negotiating skills and you have the making of a very successful sale. So, why wait?\nMany sellers we meet with are considering selling but believe that they can wait awhile. Waiting is always an option, but given the current market activity, with no guarantee on the future, I would recommend getting off the fence and jump in.\nThere may be some who are reading this, thinking that if it is so good and with consumer confidence being so high, why not wait awhile? The thing about hoping to find the “top” of a market is you never know it is the top until it drops, and it is rolling down and you can never recapture the top.\nFor many of the reasons mentioned above, it is also a great time to buy! Based on the numbers of buyers looking at our listings, this is not a secret. Home prices are gently rising, gone are the days of huge jumps from month to month.\nEven though inventory is low, there are motivated sellers who have made the decision to move to their next location, and they are marketing their home at a fair price.\nInterest rates are low, and even though they might go lower, it’s just like the seller who looks to sell only at the peak, if a buyer is waiting to buy only when interest rates are at the bottom, we won’t know the bottom is here, until rates start to go back up, and you can never recapture that previously lower rate.\nMany lenders will lock a buyer into a rate and, if the rate drops, adjust the loan to the lower interest rate, so the risk is minimized.\nWith rates this low, it is a good time to consider purchasing an investment property or second home. Even if housing, like the stock market, has an adjustment, rents have consistently risen over the past decade.\nAs the shortage of housing in all price-points, especially workforce housing and first-time homebuyers housing, continues, the demand for rentals and therefore the price to rent will remain stable and possibly climb. What better way to protect your future, then through passive income received from a rental property?\nDespite the current world news, real estate remains a solid investment, and there appears to be no better time to sell or buy. We’d love to talk to you about what that looks like for you.\nKim Murphy can be reached at kim@murphy-realty.com or (760) 415-9292 or at 130 N. Main Ave., in Fallbrook.
